## Vault Organization

In Obsidian, we structure the vault into three main sections:

- **Recipes**: This is where you store all your recipes.
- **Notes**: This section is dedicated to general cooking-related notes and additional information.
- **Calendar**: Here, you can create a calendar view to plan your meals and record meals for future periods.

## Quick Content Creation

Obsidian offers handy shortcuts to swiftly create new entries or notes:

- For a new entry (applicable to all types), use `OPTION + ESC`.
- To create a new note, simply press `OPTION + 1`.
- For a new recipe, use `OPTION + 2`.
- To plan a new meal, hit `OPTION + 3`.

## Vault Navigation

To streamline your navigation through your vault, make use of these shortcuts:

- To toggle the left sidebar, press `OPTION + [LEFT ARROW]`.
- To toggle the right sidebar, press `OPTION + [RIGHT ARROW]`.
- To navigate back and forth, use `CONTROL + OPTION + SHIFT + LEFT ARROW KEY` and `CONTROL + OPTION + SHIFT + RIGHT ARROW KEY`, respectively.

## Efficient Search Techniques

Searching within your vault is a breeze with these techniques:

- To search the entire vault, use `COMMAND + SHIFT + F`.
- To look at specific file names, type `file:[name_of_file]`. For instance, `file:chocolate_chip_cookies`.
- To search within the content, type `content:[what_you_looking_for]`. For example, `content:gluten-free`.
- To search by any properties, type `[genre:[what_genre_you_looking_for]]`. For instance, `[genre:poulet]`. The search popup helps you understand your search queries better.

## Locating Panels by Genre

To locate panels by genre within your vault, use `Genre: [genre_keyword]`. For example, `Genre: poulet`.

## Useful Shortcuts

Obsidian provides several useful shortcuts to streamline your workflow:

- To insert a template, use `OPTION + T`. This shortcut comes in handy when you forget to leverage the original template builder.

## Enhancing Functionality with Plugins

In your vault, we have several community plugins that enhance the functionality of Obsidian:

- Commander: Functionality to be determined.
- Dataview: This plugin enables you to filter recipes, use the calendar view, and manage your resources/filters.
