# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line a [baking sheet](https://beamingbaker.com/recommends/cookie-sheet/ "Baking Sheet") with [parchment paper](https://beamingbaker.com/recommends/unbleached-parchment-paper/ "Unbleached Parchment Paper") or wax paper. Clear some space in the freezer for this sheet. Set aside at room temperature.
2. In a medium bowl, add all **Snickerdoodle Cookies** ingredients: cashew butter, maple syrup, [coconut flour](https://amzn.to/3vmYVI2), cinnamon and vanilla. Use a rubber spatula to fold until well incorporated and thickened. Cover bowl and freeze for 15-20 minutes.
3. Remove from freezer. Using a cookie scoop, scoop and drop balls onto the prepared baking sheet, spaced evenly apart. Here are the [small](https://beamingbaker.com/recommends/1-tablespoon-cookie-scoop/ "Small Cookie Scoop") and [medium cookie scoops](https://beamingbaker.com/recommends/2-tablespoon-cookie-scoop/ "Medium Cookie Scoop") I use.
4. Using a fork, flatten cookies to desired thickness. Optionally, make additional fork marks in the opposite direction for a crisscross pattern on the cookies.
5. Transfer back to the freezer to chill for 20-30 minutes, until somewhat firm.*
6. Add cinnamon and [monkfruit sweetener](https://beamingbaker.com/recommends/granulated-monkfruit-sweetener-1lb-classic/ "Granulated Monkfruit Sweetener 1lb - Classic") (or sugar) to a small bowl. Stir together until well mixed. Drop and press cookie down into mixture, allowing cinnamon sugar to adhere to cookie. Flip and rotate cookie to coat. Place cookie back onto baking sheet. Repeat for all cookies. Enjoy! Storing instructions below.
