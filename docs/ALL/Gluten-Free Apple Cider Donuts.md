Tender gluten free apple cider donuts smell like the best donuts at the apple orchard, with plenty of cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg and rich, flavorful apple cider baked right into the batter.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F. Grease 2 standard-size 6 well donut pans and set them aside.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cream of tartar, 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, nutmeg, and 3/4 cup granulated sugar, and whisk to combine well.
3. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture, and add the butter, eggs, and cider, and mix to combine. The batter will be very soft.
4. Transfer the batter to a piping bag fitted with a plain tip or to a squeeze bottle.
5. Squeeze the batter into the prepared doughnut wells until they are each about 3/4 of the way full. Shake the pan back and forth horizontally until the batter is in an even layer in each well.
6. Place the pan in the center of the preheated oven and bake until the tops of the donuts spring back when pressed gently (about 12 minutes). The underside will be browned, but the tops will still be relatively pale.
7. Remove the pan from the oven and allow the donuts to cool for about 3 minutes, or until they are no longer hot to the touch.
8. While the donuts cool slightly, place the cinnamon sugar topping ingredients into a small bowl.
9. Gently remove the slightly cooled (but still warm) donuts from the doughnut pan with your fingertips and turn them around in the cinnamon sugar until they are well-coated on all sides.
10. Place the finished donuts on a clean sheet of parchment paper. Serve immediately, or at least within a day or two stored uncovered at room temperature.
11. Freeze any remaining leftovers in a sealed, freezer-safe container.
