2. Mix in water and oil. If using a stand mixer, beat at medium speed for 3-4 minutes.  
3. Put in 1 greased and floured 8×4 bread pans. Let rise until just about to the top of the pan, about 15 minutes.  
4. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45-50 minutes.

## NOTES

Also note that my mom does live at a pretty extreme altitude (7300 ft.) so you may also need to tweek it little (more or less cook time, more or less liquid and possibly more yeast) to make it work at sea level. Another note if you haven’t made much gluten-free bread the “dough” is much more like a thick cake batter and only needs to rise once much quicker! I think I’m going to have to try this too!! She did say “if they like and miss the taste of a real yeast bread they will love this!”
