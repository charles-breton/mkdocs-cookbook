# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut each eggplant lengthwise into slices, about half an inch thick. Take the largest eight slices and place on a baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and let it sit for 20 minutes.
2. Thoroughly rinse the eggplant slices and pat dry.
3. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the coconut oil and heat until glistening. Add the eggplant slices two at a time. Cook until browned, about three minutes per side. Remove from pan and set aside to drain on paper towels. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.
4. Roast the bell peppers on the grill, or on a grill pan, preheated on high. Arrange whole peppers on the grill and cook until the skin is charred, or about five minutes per side.
5. Place the hot peppers in a paper bag. This allows the skin to be removed easily. Allow to cool in the bag for about 20 minutes. Pull or scrape the skin off with your fingers or a paring knife. Cut off the stem end, cut open the peppers, and scrape out the seeds and membrane. Cut into strips about one-inch wide.
6. Cut the sun-dried tomatoes into strips.
7. Assemble the sandwiches by placing an eggplant slice on a plate. Spread each slice with goat cheese and top as desired with slices of roasted peppers, sun-dried tomatoes, and basil leaves. To complete the sandwich, place another eggplant slice on top.
