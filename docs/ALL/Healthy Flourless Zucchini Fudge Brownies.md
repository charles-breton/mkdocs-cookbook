# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8 x 8 pan with greaseproof paper or tin foil, with some overlay for easy removal. Grease it lightly and set aside.
    
2. In a microwave safe bowl or stovetop, combine your chopped chocolate with coconut oil and melt together- The mixture should be silky smooth. Add your vanilla extract and mix lightly.
    
3. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl and add your eggs, sea salt and coconut palm sugar and mix until fully incorporated. Add your grated zucchini, cocoa powder and arrowroot powder and whisk VERY well, until the batter is no longer grainy and smooth. Top with chocolate chips, if desired. Transfer to lined baking dish.
    
4. Bake the brownies for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre just comes out clean. Do not over bake. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan completely. If possible, once cooled, transfer to the fridge to chill for the best texture.

## NOTES

1. Do not over bake- Brownies may not look 'cooked' but once cooled, they will firm up.
    
2. Brownies can be kept for up to 5 days in the fridge and are freezer friendly.
