# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place all marinade ingredients into a blender. Blend on high and pour over chicken, coating well. Marinate in refrigerator for 4-6 hours.
2. Cook lentils to package directions.
3. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place a wire rack on a sheet tray and place chicken on the rack, leaving the marinade on the chicken. Discard any remaining marinade. Cook for 20-25 minutes or until the juices run clear and internal temperature reaches 74°C (165°). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before serving.
4. Place a large frying pan over high heat and add a splash of vegetable oil. When oil is hot add shredded carrot, broccoli and salt. Sauté for 2 minutes and add cooked lentils.  Cook for 2 more minutes.
5. Place yogurt and cilantro in a small bowl and whisk well.
6. To plate, split vegetable and lentil side dish mixture between four plates, spreading evenly. Place two chicken drumsticks on top of the vegetables. Add a spoonful of yogurt beside the chicken. Serve and enjoy.
