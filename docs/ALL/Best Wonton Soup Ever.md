O.M.G. ... YOU MUST TRY THIS RECIPE! I have been wanting to make homemade wonton soup for SO long now and finally got to make it for my girlies last night and we all thought it was the BEST wonton soup we have ever had. It was actually pretty easy which surprised me and the flavor was incredible. Making the won tons was a bit time consuming but I though it was really fun... Here is the recipe which I found on [allrecipes.com](http://allrecipes.com/)!!!

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Dice the green onions, set aside all but 1 tablespoon. Slice the mushrooms, and set aside all but 1 tablespoon. Finely chop the 1 tablespoon of green onions and 1 tablespoon of sliced mushrooms and place in a bowl with the ground pork, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, egg, bread crumbs, salt and pepper.  ?? Oyster sauce?? Stir to thoroughly mix the pork filling.

2. Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the pork filling onto the center of each wonton paper. Use a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Moisten the two long ends of the triangle, fold them together, and press them firmly to seal.

3. Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Drop the wontons, one by one, into the broth, and let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until they float to the surface.
4. Reduce heat to a simmer, and gently stir in the shrimp, bok choy, and reserved sliced mushrooms. Let the soup simmer for 2 more minutes, until the shrimp turn pink, and then drop in the snow peas.
5. Garnish with the remaining green onions and a dash of soy sauce and sesame oil, and serve immediately.
