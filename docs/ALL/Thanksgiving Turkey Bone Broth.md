## PREP

**Prep Time:** 5 minutes • **Cook Time:** 5–10 minutes **Yield:** Makes four 8-ounce cups (1 quart)

# INGREDIENTS

4 cups (1 quart) Turkey Bone Broth _(see previous page)_ 2 ribs celery, diced

1 carrot, diced

1 small clove garlic, crushed

1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon ground sage or Bell’s Seasoning _(see Note)_ 1 clove

Celtic or pink Himalayan salt

Ground black pepper


# INSTRUCTIONS

Heat the broth in a saucepan over medium heat. Add the celery, carrot, garlic, sage, and clove. Reduce the heat to medium-low or low so the broth barely simmers for 5 to 10 minutes, just until the carrots and celery are tender.

  

Remove and discard the garlic and clove. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
