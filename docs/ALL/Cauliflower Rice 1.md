# INSTRUCTIONS

### Choose a Cauliflower

When picking out a cauliflower, look firm, tight white florets and bright green leaves. The base of the stem should look moist and even colored.  
  
Store unwashed cauliflower in the refrigerator in an open or perforated plastic bag for 5 to 7 days. When cooking or serving cauliflower, peel off any of the outer leaves.

### Cut the Low Carb Cauliflower

Next, cut the stalk from around the head of the cauliflower. If you were to boil or steam the cauliflower, cut the florets into similar sized pieces for even cooking.  
  
Cauliflower is great for low carb recipes because it's low in fat and carbs and high in fiber. For this recipe, I will we be grating the cauliflower to use as a substitute for rice. So, cut the florets into large chunks that will fit in the mouth of your food processor.  
  
Process fresh cauliflower until it is the size of rice, either using the plain steel blade or the shredder blade. If you don t have a food processor you could also use a hand-held grater or cut it very finely by hand.

### Cook the Low Carb Cauliflower Rice

Place the riced cauliflower into a microwave safe covered dish. Cook in the microwave for 4-5 minutes. You don t need to add any water, just cook it as is. When it's done, you ll have a slightly firm, but tender rice alternative. Add some butter, salt and pepper and serve.
