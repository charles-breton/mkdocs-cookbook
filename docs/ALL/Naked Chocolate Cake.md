# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (fan-forced).
    
2. Combine the cocoa, coconut flour, baking powder and sea salt into a mixing bowl.
    
3. Add the eggs, honey, vanilla, coconut milk and olive oil.
    
4. Mix well until smooth and combined - a whisk works well for this.
    
5. Pour into a 20 cm (9 inch) baking tin lined with baking paper.
    
6. Bake the cake for 55 - 60 minutes or until cooked through. Test after 45 mins as oven temperatures may vary.
    
7. Remove from the oven and cool.

## NOTES

My Naked Chocolate Cake is super moist and decadent and you've got the option of topping it with your favourite frosting.

My frosting of choice is a velvety chocolate ganache or for a lighter frosting spread it generously with my healthy chocolate mousse.  [[The Ultimate Chocolate Mousse]]

Alternatively frost with thick Greek Style yoghurt or whipped coconut yoghurt.
