## NOTES

## TIPS

- This recipe makes approximately 3 cups of frosting.
- I highly recommend the [beater blade](http://amzn.to/2BliLGB) if you have a KitchenAid stand mixer. It scrapes the sides and beats at the same time, which is awesome.
    
- It's really easy to make cashew milk, for use in this recipe and others. Make sure to check out my recipe and video on [homemade cashew milk](https://downshiftology.com/videos/make-cashew-milk-dairy-free/).
