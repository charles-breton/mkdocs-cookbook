# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, combine rolled oats and puffed rice cereal; set aside.
2. In a small saucepan on medium-high heat, whisk together coconut oil, brown sugar, almond butter and honey and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium-low, continually whisking, and allow mixture to simmer for about 2 minutes. Remove mixture from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.
3. Pour mixture over the dry oat mixture and fold together so everything is evenly coated. Stir in one tablespoon of chocolate chips and transfer to a prepared 9×13-inch baking dish lined with parchment paper.
4. Press granola mixture firmly into the baking dish (I used extra parchment paper to press down to avoid granola from sticking to my fingers) and sprinkle remaining chocolate chips over top along with a pinch of sea salt. Cover and refrigerate for two hours.
5. Remove from refrigerator and lift the parchment paper so the bars are easily removed from the baking dish. Cut into 18 bars and store at room temp individually wrapped in plastic wrap or freeze for later.
