Feeling bogged down with chocolate bunnies and candy coated eggs?  I mean, they've been in the stores since mid-February now.  With all of the treats and sweets, it's nice to work some healthy alternatives into the Easter mix.  A giant bunny head fruit platter is sure to bring a few smiles to the breakfast table or party table.  No baking skills required and I'll show you, step-by-step, how to create this fun fresh fruit display.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. The package of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries were from Costco, so they are the larger containers.  Probably $25-$30 of fruit for the 12"x15" platter with plenty to spare in a separate bowl.

2. Start by selecting your fruits.  We chose strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, pineapple, kiwis, and pear.  Wash and then slice/dice the strawberries, pineapple, kiwis and pear.   Keep two larger rectangles of pear set aside to use for the bunny's teeth.   Start by taking the pineapple pieces and cup two circles together for the bunny's cheeks.  Then place two pear arches above the cheeks for the "whites of the eyes" (as seen below):

3. Place the kiwi in the shapes of bunny ears and place sliced strawberries for the "pink" inner ear:

4. Fill in the rest of the head with pineapple and outline the ears with more pineapple.  Place blueberries for the large eye balls.  Place a large raspberry for the nose.  Place two large pieces of pear for the teeth.  Fill in the background with remaining fruit.

5. The  more contrast between fruit colors, the more the bunny head will pop from the fruit platter.  String cheese seems to work the best to create the bunny's whiskers.  You could also slice a banana lengthwise to keep it all fruit.  Keep in mind, bananas, apples and pears may start to brown if the platter is going to sit for several hours.  To help keep these fruits from browning, dip them in cold water with lemon juice or slice under water.

6. My kids couldn't wait to dive into this fruit platter.  It is something different than the bowl of fruit salad they are used to seeing on the table.

7. Even _they_ reached for the good-for-you fruit over the sweet stuff right in front of them.  How about you?  Are you still on a Cadbury and Peeps kick?  Can I pass you the fruit?  How about a [chick fruit platter](http://www.worthpinning.com/2015/03/chick-fresh-fruit-platter.html)?
