# INSTRUCTIONS

1. To make the creamy filling, whip the coconut cream, powdered sugar and vanilla paste until fluffy and soft peaks form. 
2. Start assembling the tiramisu by dipping [the gluten free ladyfingers](https://theloopywhisk.com/2018/03/13/perfect-gluten-free-ladyfingers/) into **cold** unsweetened coffee and laying them on the bottom of a serving dish of your choice. Make an even layer with little/no gaps between the ladyfingers – fill in any gaps by breaking the ladyfingers into pieces before dipping them into coffee.
    
    _I don't recommend using hot coffee, as it can cause the ladyfingers to become too fragile and fall apart._
    
3. Spoon half of the creamy filling on top of the ladyfingers. Smooth out the filling to make an even layer.
4. Place another layer of [ladyfingers](https://theloopywhisk.com/2018/03/13/perfect-gluten-free-ladyfingers/), soaked in coffee, on top of the creamy filling.
5. Spoon the rest of the filling on top of the second layer of ladyfingers and smooth out the top.
6. Dust with cocoa powder.
7. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
8. Before serving, dust with a bit more cocoa powder, and enjoy!
9. The dairy and gluten free tiramisu keeps well in a closed container (or covered in cling film/kitchen foil) in the fridge for about 1 week.

## NOTES

_The ingredients listed below are sufficient for an oval serving dish of approximate dimensions: width=8 inch (21 cm), length=12 inch (30 cm). You can easily adapt the recipe to different serving dish sizes by increasing/decreasing the quantities._


**Note 1:** [Get the recipe to make the gluten free ladyfingers here!](https://theloopywhisk.com/2018/03/13/perfect-gluten-free-ladyfingers/)

**Note 2:** Depending on how intense you want the coffee flavour to be, make the coffee as strong as you want!

**Note 3:** You can get coconut cream by putting coconut milk (with a high coconut content and without too many stabilisers/preservatives) into the fridge overnight – without shaking! The coconut milk will separate into coconut cream (that you'll need in this recipe) and coconut water (which _you should NOT use_ in this recipe, but is great in smoothies).
