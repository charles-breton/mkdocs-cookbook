|It's always a struggle to get kids to eat their veggies, so why not hide a serving in their breakfast? This PB&J Morning Muffin recipe includes grated carrots and zucchini masked with the familiar flavor of peanut butter and jelly that kids love. These muffins are gluten-free and dairy-free, plus they are packed with fiber and healthy fats.|

|These muffins are a little high in calories because they are intended to serve as a complete breakfast. Studies show that kids who eat a nutritious breakfast score higher on standardized tests (Source: [USDA](http://email.dailyburn.com/wf/click?upn=REjgVgX6rkqnTBgmtTOVh5P-2FiQHvD2Zl6dFsItO-2FQ7DEpToca2YQDOvXZnUOO8QOC0cYehs39AirD3liN111nEcgFoPR9SJ4oKdxg0pMOTqkRRPy7mim1G-2F53n4YrN4vw9oe0CwyngTccQV60UynE-2BiisuMo-2BpQelK8s0M5Cyn8DltWJ5weypKCc3BSiZU6L_hfIqhjxrH5PXl2rHT1sLDeHcs0liPe1s8LO1HcPBjVx-2BB8jWeIZXVc00o-2FH4KYlS1vmvdtrkoQq2kL5Dhz1iPm-2F0XKgruiWpUOFp4oBotws-2FHprH5S1Z8KfJmUg0-2FQPZZZcPyadSBV-2BxfUDhKDRpMC5dlqGnTg18h7HFe4gGFKHbJ3Kz3O1zGwuruGqHIgsP6L-2F-2BZu9B1TZrQKAlxLyb83rVCWke1HBK-2FRL7ii249BSu5maLAf-2BxzvXcDZyErWpR8op3b4gZrHKonrHfR1vxFQBPmxqPWLHWw3Iy30gNFwMyx7A0rfWIw7cGbQ4NA9A7qaSFoK6gL1lqN125tajz8bAL-2FUrX7gB4iF1nlYSWSwvxsoGnVyEu-2Bb3I9pfDVcSA)).|

|It's easy to prepare these muffins on a Sunday evening. They are a perfect grab and go breakfast for the week ahead. You can also freeze half of the batch and defrost / heat them as you need them, but they are so tasty that they will probably be gobbled up faster than you think.|
