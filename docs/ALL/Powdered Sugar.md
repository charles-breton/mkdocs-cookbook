# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the sugar and arrowroot powder in a high-powered blender. Add the lid and blend on high for 30 seconds. You may also want to use a towel to cover the top of the blender, to prevent any powder from escaping.
2. Turn the blender off and let the powdered sugar settle for at least 2 minutes. Transfer the powdered sugar to an airtight storage container.
