If there’s a dish that Vietnamese cuisine is most known for, it’s a steaming and comforting bowl of pho (pronounced as “fuh”). Considered Vietnam’s national dish,1 pho begins with tender rice noodles and thinly sliced raw beef. Hot and flavorful broth is poured over these ingredients, cooking the beef.2 Finishing touches include herbs, bean sprouts, scallions, chili peppers, lime wedges and other garnishes.3

If you want to bring the flavors of Vietnam into your home, try making this Satisfyingly Light Vietnamese Pho Recipe. The harmony between savory, sweet and spicy flavors makes this a very unique dish that’s perfect for sharing or as an individual serving. Plus, instead of rice noodles, it uses healthier and lighter [shirataki noodles](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/05/23/shirataki-noodles-high-fiber-food.aspx).

# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Procedure for Cooking:  

1. Place beef bones in large pot and cover with 4 quarts of cold filtered water. Cook on high heat and bring it to a boil. Boil for 3 to 4 minutes. During this time, foam (or scum) will be released and rise to the top.
    
2. Drain the bones, discard the water and rinse the bones with warm water. Scrub your stockpot to remove any residue that was left behind.
    
3. Add the bones back to the stockpot and cover with 4 quarts of cold filtered water. Bring to a boil and then lower to a gentle simmer.
    
4. Place halved onions and sliced ginger on baking sheet and broil on high for 10 to 15 minutes, turning occasionally so they can brown or char on all sides.
    
5. Add star anise, cinnamon stick, coriander seeds and whole cloves to a dry frying pan. Place onto low heat and cook until fragrant. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Place toasted spices into an herb sachet or cheesecloth then tie with twine to seal.
    
6. Add salt, fish sauces, sachet of spices, charred onion and ginger to the stockpot.
    
7. Continue to simmer broth uncovered for 6 hours. If at any time foam or scum rises to the surface, skim it out with a spoon.
    
8. Carefully remove bones, sachet of spices, onion and ginger from the broth. Then strain the broth through a fine mesh strainer.
    
9. The broth will have a layer of fat. You can either skim the surface of the broth using a spoon or you can refrigerate the broth overnight and as the broth cools, the fat will solidify on the surface, making it easy to remove.
    
#### **Procedure for Assembly:**

1. Place broth over medium heat and bring to a gentle simmer.
    
2. Arrange shirataki noodles and raw meat into the bowls, then top with hot broth.
    
3. Let the noodles and beef sit in the hot broth for 1 to 2 minutes, until the raw meat is no longer pink and the noodles are cooked.
    
4. Add bean sprouts, Thai basil, jalapeno slices and scallions, and enjoy!
