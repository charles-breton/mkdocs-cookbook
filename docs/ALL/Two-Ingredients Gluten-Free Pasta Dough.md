**Faire 2 recettes pour 5 serait assez) La 2ème fois a été difficile a couper et séparer , peut-être à cause du mélange différent de farine utilisé (Pamela's all purpose) 1ère fois Bob's 1for1**

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ]  1 1/4 cup + 2 Tbsp. Bob’s Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten-Free Baking Flour + a little extra flour for workspace
- [ ] 3 large eggs
- [ ] Kosher salt (pinch) for boiling water – do NOT add to pasta dough

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add the flour and eggs to a food processor using the dough blade. Mix well until dough forms. Do not overwork dough. 
2. Remove dough from food processor and place on a floured surface. 
3. If dough is sticky, add a sprinkle of flour and knead the dough for 30 seconds until the texture is still wet but not sticky. Remember, gluten-free dough doesn't need kneading since there is no gluten to develop. 
4. Wrap dough in plastic wrap and set aside as you prepare your pasta machine or workspace. You want your dough to stay moist and air will dry it out. 

#### **If Using a Pasta Machine:**

1. Work dough in batches (I divide into four balls). 
2. On a floured surface, use your rolling pin to slightly flatten one the dough so it fits through your pasta machine.  
3. Run the slightly flattened dough through your pasta roller on the largest setting (0), working dough in batches. Then run the dough through the roller on setting 1, then setting 2 until you have lasagna strips to the desired thickness. 
4. Now run the dough through pasta maker on the linguine or spaghetti setting to get your dough cut just right. Set dough aside and repeat until all dough is cut into desired thickness and strands. 

#### **If Rolling Dough by Hand (no pasta machine):**

1. Cut dough into four sections and roll out first section on a flour surface until desired thickness. 
2. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into pasta strips and set aside. Make pasta strips as even as possible (use a ruler to help you cut straight edges if you like). 
3. Work dough in batches until all dough is in desired shape. 

#### **Cooking Pasta:**

1. Add unraveled pasta strands to salted boiling water for 1-2 minutes. Do not overcrowd pan (work in batches if necessary depending on your pan size). The pasta cooks fast so watch it carefully and be ready to remove the pasta from the water quickly to avoid overcooking it. 
2. Drain and rinse noodles with cold water. Serve immediately with your favorite sauce.

## NOTES

   - When making the dough, remember you want it to be wet but not sticky. It must be wet enough to work with, but not too wet that it sticks to the pasta machine or your countertop.
   - To get the pasta looking so cook, I'll often cut off frayed edges. I'll use leftover pasta dough and run it through the pasta machine again until I use up all the excess dough.
   - Cook pasta in batches. It may stick together when boiling, so you want to make sure you don't overcrowd your pot. 
   - To prevent pasta from sticking together once cooked, coat it with a drizzle of olive oil. The oil will keep the pasta from sticking and mushing together. Ideally you would eat the pasta right away after cooking. The taste and texture is the best right after boiling the pasta in water for 1-2 minutes.
