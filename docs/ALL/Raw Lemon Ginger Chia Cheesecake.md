# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Process all crust ingredients, except maple syrup, in a food processor until a sticky crumble is formed. Add maple syrup and process again to combine. Remove a tiny bit of the mixture and form into a few little balls with your hands, set aside. Transfer the rest of the crust mixture into a5" springform panand press to form a crust along the base and a bit up the edges all around. Place the pan in the freezer while working on the next step.

2. Blend all filling ingredients, except chia seeds, in a power blender until completely smooth. Add in chia and either stir with a spoon or pulse very briefly to fold the seeds in without grinding them down (don't overblend -- you want those seeds visible in the cake!). Pour this mixture into the pan over the crust. Smooth out the top (I let mine be a bit rustic). Top with a few slices of lemon, the balls, and sprinkle with chia.
  
3. Freeze for 5 hours or overnight. Decorate with rosemary sprig before serving. I recommend allowing the cake to thaw out a bit prior to serving for a softer consistency. Keep leftovers frozen. Enjoy!
