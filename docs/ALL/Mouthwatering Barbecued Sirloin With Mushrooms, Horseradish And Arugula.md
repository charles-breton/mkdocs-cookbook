Sirloin is one of the most popular and versatile cuts of beef, although it does come behind options such as rib eye, New York strip, beef tenderloin and T-bone steak.1 It’s a relatively lean cut, without a lot of marbling, and according to The Spruce, should be marinated or pounded to better tenderize the meat.

If you have a nice piece of sirloin at home but don’t know how to prepare it, check out this Mouthwatering Barbecued Sirloin With Mushrooms, Horseradish and Arugula recipe from internationally renowned chef Pete Evans. Evans and I have recently collaborated to create a Keto cookbook, which will feature various ketogenic recipes that can be prepared for everyday meals and special occasions. The cookbook will be out on November 14, so keep your eyes peeled!

## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

-   
    4 [grass fed sirloin steaks](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/grass-fed-beef.html), about 1/2 pound each
- 2 tablespoons [Dr. Mercola’s coconut oil](http://products.mercolamarket.com/coconut-oil/?adobe_mc=MCMID%3D74059164991534334861908926781216701162%7CMCORGID%3D2082401053DB12AC0A490D4C%2540AdobeOrg%7CTS%3D1695080582)
- 1/3 pound Swiss brown mushrooms, sliced
- 1/4 pound oyster mushrooms, sliced
- 2 [garlic](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/garlic.html) cloves, crushed
- 3 [thyme](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/thyme.html) sprigs, chopped
- 1 tablespoon chopped flat-leaf [parsley](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/parsley.html) leaves
- 1 tablespoon grated fresh [horseradish](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/05/30/horseradish-benefits.aspx)
- 2 lemons, cut into wedges
- 3 tablespoons extra-virgin oil
- Salt and fresh ground pepper



# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat barbecue until it’s hot. Coat the steaks with a little of the coconut oil and season with salt and pepper.
2. Cook the steaks on one side for two to three minutes, then flip over and cook for another two to three minutes, or until cooked to your liking (avoid charring the meat).
3. Remove the steaks from the heat, place on a plate and cover. Allow the steaks to rest for four to six minutes in a warm place.
4. Heat the remaining coconut oil, add the mushrooms, garlic and thyme and sauté until the mushrooms are cooked through for two to four minutes. Season with salt and pepper, stir in the parsley, then remove from the heat and cover to keep warm.
5. Toss the arugula with the olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and season with salt and pepper.
6. Once the steaks have rested, return them to a very hot barbecue and cook for 30 seconds on each side to make sure they are warm.
7. Place each steak on a serving plate, and then sprinkle with the horseradish. Serve the steaks with the salad, sautéed mushrooms and lemon wedges.
