## NOTES

First crepe (or two) may not always turn out perfectly. It is totally appropriate that you do a taste test to make sure they are good and continue with the rest.You may need to butter the pan every so often (after 3-4 crepes). Simply add 1/4 teaspoon of butter onto the pan and swirl to be sure there's a good amount of fat covering the pan.Use a measuring cup to deliver just enough batter onto the pan (1/4 cup works perfectly!).Be sure to stir the batter every so often as flour settles on the bottom, changing the consistency of it. You may need to add a few tablespoons of additional milk as you come towards the end of your batter supply. Toppings include: fruit, jams, jellies, sour cream, cheese, spinach and other greens, butter and salmon roe, cured salmon, etc.

## TIPS

**_Pro tip:_** To help faciliate proper blending, add the ingredients in this order: milk, eggs, butter, honey, flour, and salt.

**Practice makes perfect** - Don't be discouraged if the first few crepes don't turn out perfectly. In fact, it is customary and totally appropriate for the cook to eat the first few.

**Preheat the pan** - A properly heated pan ensures that the crepes cook evenly and quickly. Preheat the pan first on medium heat then melt the butter.

**Measure with a measuring cup** - Use a ¼-cup measuring to deliver just the right amount of batter.

**Use a crepe spreader** - Though not necessary, this tool will help you easily distribute the batter in the pan to achieve thin and uniform crepes.

**Watch the crepes closely** - Be attentive while cooking the crepes as they cook quickly. Avoid leaving the pan unattended to prevent burning.

**Stir the batter often** - Be sure to stir often as flour settles on the bottom, changing the consistency of it. You may need to add a few tablespoons of milk to thin it out as you get low on the batter.
