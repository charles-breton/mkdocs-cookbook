# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Warm 1 to 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat (amount of oil will depend on the size of your pan; use enough to cover the bottom with a thin layer). Stir in smoked paprika. Add mushrooms and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, stirring once or twice, until mushrooms are tender and lightly browned. Transfer to a bowl and season with salt.
    
2. Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine crushed tomatoes, garlic, and 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small saucepan and warm over medium-low heat for about 5 to 7 minutes. Season with salt.
    
3. Warm another tablespoon of oil in the same skillet over high heat. Crack eggs into skillet, immediately reduce heat to medium-low and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until whites are just set and edges are crispy, covering skillet for the last 2 minutes of cooking time.
    
4. Spread 2 to 3 tablespoons tomato sauce over each of 4 pizza bases. Top each with one-fourth of mushrooms, a fried egg and parsley. Season with additional salt, if desired.
