# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cook the quinoa using the stove top steaming method. Bring the broth to a boil and add in quinoa and salt to taste. Boil for 10 minutes. Drain quinoa and rinse with cool water. Rinse the pot and bring fresh water to a boil. Place quinoa in a metal colander and put over the boiling water. Cover with a clean dish cloth and lid. Steam for 10 minutes. Remove from heat and allow the quinoa to cool. (Alternatively, you could also cook the quinoa in a vegetable steamer.)

2. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix together corn, red pepper, scallions, cranberries, carrots, cilantro and 2 T of the red onion.

3. In your blender combine remaining 1 T of red onion, garlic, soy sauce, lemon juice, olive oil, cumin and dried chipotle pepper. Pulse until well combined.

4. Combine quinoa and vegetable mixture and toss with dressing. Top with almonds and pumpkin seeds
