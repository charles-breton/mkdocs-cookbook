# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and grease a medium-sized baking sheet with some coconut oil.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, egg whites, coconut milk, and coconut oil.
3. Stir in the psyllium and coconut flour.
4. Stir in the salt, baking soda, and apple cider vinegar.
5. Let sit for minute or two; it will thicken up like sticky dough.
6. Form into a long thin baguette on the baking sheet.
7. Bake for 55 to 60 minutes. The bread will puff way up; don't let this fool you; it takes quite a long time for the bread to cook through.
8. Let cool... just kidding; slice it up and serve it warm with soft butter!!
