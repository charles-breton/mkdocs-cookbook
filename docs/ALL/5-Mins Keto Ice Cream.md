## NOTES

**Sweetener:** You can use any sweetener you like, to taste, in this recipe. However, granular sweeteners may make the ice cream gritty.

_I use my own [blend of xylitol, erythritol, and stevia](https://joyfilledeats.com/sweetener/) in most of my recipes. This is twice as sweet as sugar. It is comparable to [Trim Healthy Mama Gentle Sweet](https://store.trimhealthymama.com/product/gentle-sweet-xylitol-erythritol-stevia-ground-blend-3lb-bag/?ref=50) and [Truvia](https://amzn.to/2MjGDhY). It is slightly sweetener than_ _[Swerve](https://amzn.to/2MlbUBk) or [Lakanto Monk Fruit](https://amzn.to/2wIYnAW). It is less sweet than_ _[Pyure](https://amzn.to/2MTpVam) or [Trim Healthy Mama Super Sweet](https://store.trimhealthymama.com/product/super-sweet-blend-erythritol-stevia-3lb-bag/?ref=50)._
