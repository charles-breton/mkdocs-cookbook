## PREP

Makes: 3½ to 4 quarts

# INGREDIENTS

About 4½ lb beef knuckle and marrowbones

3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar 

3 lb meaty beef rib or neck bones 

3 onions, roughly chopped 

3 carrots, roughly chopped 

3 celery stalks, roughly chopped 

2 leeks (white part only), roughly chopped 

3 thyme sprigs 

2 bay leaves 

1 tsp black peppercorns, crushed 

1 garlic bulb, cut in half horizontally 

2 large handfuls flat-leaf parsley stalks


# INSTRUCTIONS

_Place the knuckle and marrowbones in a stockpot. Add the vinegar and pour in 5 quarts of cold filtered water, or enough to cover the bones. Set aside for 1 hour to help draw out the nutrients from the bones. Remove the bones from the pot, leaving  the water in the pot. 

_Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the knuckle and marrowbones, along with the meaty beef bones, in a large roasting pan (if bones are crowded, use multiple roasting pans so that more of their surfaces are exposed to the air and can brown) and roast in the oven for 30 to 40 minutes, until well browned. 

_Return ali the bones to the stockpot and add the onions, carrots, celery, and leeks. Place over high heat and bring to a simmer, stirring with a wooden spoon to loosen any coagulated juices. If necessary, add more water to just cover the bones; the liquid should come no higher than ¾ inch below the rim of the pot, as the volume will increase slightly during cooking. 

_Bring the broth to a boil, skimming off any scum that rises to the top. Reduce the heat to low and add the thyme, bay leaves, peppercorns, and garlic. Simmer for 12 to 24 hours. Just before finishing, add the parsley and simmer for 10 minutes. 

_Strain the broth into a large container, cover, and place in the fridge overnight. Remove the congealed fat that rises to the top and reserve for cooking; it will keep in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer the thick and gelatinous broth to smaller airtight containers. 

_The broth can be stored in the fridge for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
