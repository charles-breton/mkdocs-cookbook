# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grease one 9"x5" loaf pan (or 8"x8" square pan) and preheat the oven to 350ºF.

2. In a large bowl or mixer, combine the mashed bananas, eggs, coconut oil, vanilla extract and nut butter until fully combined.

3. Add the coconut flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and sea salt to the wet ingredients and mix well. Fold in the chocolate chunks.

4. Pour the batter into the prepared pan and spread it evenly.

5. Bake in the preheated oven for 55-60 minutes (40 minutes for an 8x8" pan). A toothpick inserted into the center should come out clean and if you press down light on the top of the loaf, it should bounce back.

6. Remove from oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for about ½ hour. Flip out onto a cooling rack to finish cooling.
