# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Put the cut potatoes into a large casserole, roaster or baking pan.
2. Mix together the remaining ingredients and pour over the potatoes. They should be almost completely covered. Add a little more water and/or lemon juice if needed.
3. Bake, uncovered, at 325°F until the potatoes are well cooked. Add water during the roasting if the sauce gets too thick or boils dry. Stir at least once part way through roasting.
4. I’ve found that roasting time is very dependent on the type of potato and the thickness of the pieces. But it generally takes 2 to 2-1/2 hours to bake.
5. Rather than cutting into wedges, I slice the potatoes in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into approximately 1/2-inch pieces. They cook more evenly than wedges.

## NOTES

_If I need my oven for preparing other items for the meal (i.e. Greek Ribs), I roast the potatoes first and put them in a warmed covered casserole when they are done. I wrap the casserole in a thick bath towel. It has kept the potatoes hot enough for up to two hours before the meal._
