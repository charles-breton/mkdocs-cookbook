# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 400 degrees.
2. Cut the very top off of the head of garlic, making sure to expose the tip of every clove. Place the coconut oil on the top and wrap in foil. Cook in the oven for 30 minutes, or until soft and lightly browned.
3. When the garlic is finished roasting, remove the cloves and place in a food processor with the cauliflower, olive oil, lemon juice, water, and sea salt. Process for a minute or two, until a thick puree forms.
4. Serve garnished with parsley, green olives, and olive oil.
