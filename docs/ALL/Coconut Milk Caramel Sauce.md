## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

1 14oz Can Coconut Milk (BPA Free)

⅓ cup coconut sugar

1 tsp vanilla extract

1 Tbsp coconut oil (or butter)

¼ tsp salt



# INSTRUCTIONS

In a small saucepan add coconut milk and sugar.

Bring to a boil over medium heat stirring frequently.

Once boiling turn down heat until it is at a slow boil and continue stirring frequently begin careful not to burn caramel sauce.

Continue boiling until sauce has reduced and thickened (it will continue to thicken as it cools) about 25-35 minutes.

Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, oil or butter and salt.

Let cool to room temperature stirring occasionally to keep the fat immersed.

Store in a glass container for 1-2 weeks.



## TIPS

Will need to stir before each use as the fat can separate out. Heating will get rid of the clumps that may occur.
