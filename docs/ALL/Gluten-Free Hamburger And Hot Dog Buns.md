# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add the yeast (+the sugar) to the 2 cups of warm water and stir until mixed. Set this aside to activate while you mix the rest of the ingredients.
2. Mix the flours, xanthum gum, gluten-free egg replacer, salt, and powdered milk together in a medium-size bowl and set aside.
3. Put eggs, butter, vinegar, and honey in the bowl of your mixer. With the paddle attachment, mix together for about 30 seconds. The butter will be chunky, that’s OK.
4. Add half the dry ingredients to the wet mixture in the mixer. Mix just until blended, and then add the remaining dry ingredients and mix for another 30 seconds, until blended. [I had to use a whisk to break the chunks]
5. With the mixer on low speed, slowly add the warm water and yeast mixture, then turn the mixer to medium-high speed and beat for 4 minutes. After the 4 minutes your bread dough should resemble thick cake batter.
6. Now your dough is ready to become delicious hamburger and hot dog buns!
7. Spray your hot dog bun pan with cooking spray, and spoon your dough evenly into the slots on the pan, filling the pan about 2/3 full. Set the pan in a warm place and allow the dough to rise for about an hour, or until the dough has risen to the top of the tray.
8. Bake your hot dog buns in a 350 oven for 30-40 minutes. Test for doneness by inserting a toothpick into the buns. If the toothpick comes out clean, they’re ready!
9. To make hamburger buns,
10. [Refrigerate the dough for at least one hour first, then put about 2 tbsp of dough on a baking pan with parchment paper and form it into a round bun shape. Not too big because they will increase in size. ]
11. Put the pan in a warm place, and let the buns rise for an hour or so.
12. After the rising process, sprinkle the tops of the buns with sesame seeds, and bake in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. [Look at 18-19]
13. It’s crucial to let your hamburger or hot dog buns cool COMPLETELY before cutting them. They tend to fall apart if handled while still warm! So this is a great project to do the day before, if you’re hosting a backyard BBQ or cookout.
