# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 garlic clove, minced
- [ ] 2 tablespoons rice vinegar

- [ ] 1/2 tablespoon water
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon each of fine sea salt and black pepper
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder (optional)
- [ ] Monk fruit to taste

#### Ingredients for the salad:

- [ ] 1 head curly kale, stemmed and ripped into 2- to 3-inch pieces (these vary in size, so start with less and add more once you see how much marinade is left)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Mix the dressing ingredients in a bowl big enough for the kale.
2. Add the kale and toss to combine.
3. Take your hands and get in there, squeezing the kale to break down the fibrous texture and work in the dressing.
4. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave at room temperature for two to three hours, or refrigerate overnight. This salad gets better with time — even days!
5. When you are ready to eat the salad, mix in 1 to 2 tablespoons of sauerkraut or tsukemono per serving.
6. Add the egg. You can go ahead and mix it in for a wonderfully messy combination of textures, or serve it in slices for a prettier presentation.
7. Drizzle your salad with a little extra olive oil or chili oil.
