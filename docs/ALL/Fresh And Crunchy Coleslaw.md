Most people think of coleslaw as an all-American dish, but did you know that it actually has Dutch roots? Coleslaw comes from the Dutch word “koolsla,” meaning “cabbage salad.” The recipe was brought to the U.S. by Dutch immigrants who settled in New York during the late 17th and 18th centuries.[1](http://recipes.mercola.com/crunchy-coleslaw-recipe.aspx?utm_source=dnl&utm_medium=email&utm_content=art2&utm_campaign=20170528Z1_UCM&et_cid=DM147011&et_rid=2021584984#_edn1)

Coleslaw is still a favorite today because of its unique flavor and texture. However, since it’s usually enjoyed raw, I recommend using only organically grown vegetables that are not sprayed with pesticides and other toxic chemicals. This Fresh and Crunchy Coleslaw Recipe uses only wholesome ingredients that blend so well together, and is sure to please everyone — even picky eaters.
