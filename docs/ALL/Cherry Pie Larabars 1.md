# INSTRUCTIONS

[NEW VERSION]

In a **food processor** fitted with an “S” blade, combine the dried cherries and dates and process until a sticky dough is formed. (Be patient– this takes a minute or so!) Add in the raw almonds, then process again until the almonds are broken down and the batter looks uniform.

The resulting mixture may appear to be a bit crumbly, but it should stick together easily when you pinch the mixture with your fingers.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, and transfer the batter to the flat surface. Press the dough into a flat, bar-like shape. (You could use a rolling pin for this, but I just used my hands.) Once the dough is evenly thick, you can slice it into 8 bars.

Separate the bars and store them in a sealed container in the fridge for best shelf life. When you need to keep a snack in your purse or bag, simply wrap one of these bars tightly in plastic wrap or parchment paper, and it should last an entire day or two at room temperature.

[OLD VERSION]

1. Add dates and cherries to food processor and process for a few minutes, until the fruit is in small pieces.
2. Add nuts and process until the mixture forms a crumbly consistency.
3. The best way to shape the bars (in my opinion) is to line a container with saran wrap and then firmly press the fruit and nut mixture into the pan. You can do one big pan and then cut it into bars or you could just use a personal sized container and make 1 bar at a time.When you're done shaping, carefully lift out the plastic and you're all done!
4. Store bars in fridge.

## NOTES

If you’d rather skip the bar-making process, you could also easily roll this mixture into balls for an easy-to-grab snack!
