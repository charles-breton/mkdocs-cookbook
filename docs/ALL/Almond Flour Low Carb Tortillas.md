# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 3/4 cup + 1 tablespoon (98 g) finely ground blanched almond flour
- [ ] 4 tablespoons (28 g) coconut flour
- [ ] 1 teaspoon (4 g) xanthan gum

- [ ] 2 to 4 tablespoons lukewarm water

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a food processor (a miniature one will do), place the almond flour, coconut flour, xanthan gum, baking powder, salt, egg and 2 tablespoons of water, and pulse to combine. If the dough holds together well and feels moist but not wet, process until it forms a ball and mostly clears the dough from the bottom of the container. If the dough feels at all dry, add more water by the teaspoonful, processing after each addition until it reaches the proper consistency. Continue to process until the dough forms a ball as directed.

2. Transfer the dough from the food processor to a piece of plastic wrap, wrap tightly and store in the refrigerator until you’re ready to make the tortillas (up to 4 days). It’s useful to allow the dough to chill for at least 10 minutes.

3. When you’re ready to make the tortillas, heat a nonstick or cast iron griddle until hot (if using an electric griddle with a temperature gauge, heat it to 375°F). Unwrap the dough and divide it into 8 pieces of equal size. Working with one piece of dough at a time, roll it into a ball between your palms and then press it into a disk. Place on a large piece of unbleached parchment paper and top with another large piece of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a round about 7-inches in diameter. For best results, periodically remove the parchment paper from either side, flipping it frequently to prevent the paper from sticking or wrinkling too much. Carefully remove the top piece of parchment by pulling it away from the dough slowly and cut out a 6-inch round using a 6-inch cake cutter or the lid of a pot. Remove the excess dough and replace the top parchment. Flip the dough over and carefully pull the paper away from the dough. It should now be rather easy to lift the dough from the papers entirely. Place it on the hot griddle and allow to cook, flipping frequently and pressing down with a wide spatula, until it’s opaque on both sides and the tortilla has developed a bit of color. Repeat with the remaining dough, stacking the warm tortillas on top of one another.

4. Serve immediately, or place a stack in a zip-top plastic bag. Place a moistened paper towel into the bag before sealing it tightly. This will help keep the tortillas moist until you are ready to serve them. They can be refreshed in a hot, dry skillet before serving if desired.
