# INSTRUCTIONS

1. . Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Cut cauliflower into florets. Trim stalks off fennel bulb. Cut in half, lengthwise, then cut ½-inch-wide (1-cm) wedges lengthwise through root. Arrange cauliflower on a baking sheet and toss with 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil. Season with salt and pepper. Arrange fennel on another baking sheet and toss with remaining 1 tbsp (15 mL) oil. Season with salt and pepper. Roast until browned and tender, rotating baking sheets after 15 minutes, about 25 to 30 minutes total, **_peut être un peu plus car il faut qu’ils rôtissent un peu._**
3. Chop fennel and combine with cauliflower. Reserve.
4. For soup, heat oil in large pot over medium heat. Add onions and sauté until tender, about 4 minutes. Stir in curry paste and cook 30 seconds. Add cauliflower, fennel, stock and fennel seeds. Bring to boil, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until all vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in spinach and lemon zest. Cook just until spinach wilts, about 1 to 3 minutes. This keeps the colour, giving the soup a beautiful green hue.
5. Purée with an immersion blender or a regular blender. Taste for seasoning, adding salt and pepper as needed. Reheat when needed and garnish with pickled red onions and fennel fronds.
