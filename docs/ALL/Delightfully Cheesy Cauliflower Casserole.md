## Sink Your Teeth Into This Delightfully Cheesy Cauliflower Hash Brown Casserole Recipe

This healthy casserole relies on two key components: cauliflower and free-range eggs, and both offer health benefits to help get you through your day. Plus, the different spices don’t just add heaps of flavor, but health boosts too. Apart from those who wish to take their casserole to the next level, this dish is perfect for those who are picky with their vegetables, especially young children. Let them try this and, who knows, they might be asking for a second serving right away!

## Let Your Health Flourish With Cauliflower

This cruciferous vegetable is a versatile ingredient you can add to other casseroles or [salads](https://recipes.mercola.com/salad.aspx), or even eat raw. In a single serving of cauliflower, you can get vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B9, C and K, alongside minerals such as protein, magnesium, fiber, phosphorus, potassium and manganese.

[Antioxidants](https://articles.mercola.com/antioxidants.aspx) such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, cinnamic acid, quercetin and rutin in cauliflower can help protect cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS), help the body combat harmful effects caused by everyday exposure to pollutants and/or chronic stress and potentially lower risk for oxidative stress that can result in accelerated tissue and organ damage.

Count on cauliflower to boost your heart health, too, since a compound called sulforaphane found in this vegetable was proven to help improve blood pressure and kidney function.1 Another vital compound in cauliflower is the anti-inflammatory indole-3-carbinol or I3C, which operates at the genetic level to assist with inhibiting inflammatory responses.2

Cauliflower also contains choline, a B vitamin heralded for its role in brain development. An animal study revealed that choline intake during a pregnancy greatly enhanced the brain activity of animals in utero.

This indicates choline’s capabilities in boosting cognitive function and improving learning and memory. Choline may also benefit people across different age groups since it was shown to help diminish age-related memory decline, reduce the brain’s vulnerability to toxins during childhood and deliver protection later in life.3

## Why Adding Free-Range Eggs to Your Diet Is Perfectly Fine

Free-range eggs are a must in this casserole to ensure that the cauliflower and spice mixture is completely blended. At the same time, they add significant nutrition to the dish. In particular, the egg yolk, which is the healthiest part of the egg, has higher amounts of [omega-3](https://articles.mercola.com/omega-3.aspx) healthy fats, vitamins A, D, E, K and B12 and nutrients like folate, compared to the whites. Other beneficial nutrients in egg yolks include:

- **Biotin or vitamin B7:** This water-soluble vitamin assists the body’s glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and can play an important role during a pregnancy.
- **Choline:** Another B vitamin, choline plays a primary role in brain development, acting as a precursor to acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that helps with muscle control and memory. Plus, choline also has anti-inflammatory properties, and may help boost the health of cell membranes.
- **Carotenoids like lutein and zeaxanthin:**4 Apart from being responsible for egg yolks’ bright yellow color, this class of antioxidants, particularly lutein (found in the macular pigment) and zeaxanthin (found in the retina), may be able to potentially reduce inflammation, enhance eye health, help absorb excess photon energy and eradicate free radicals before they damage lipid membranes.
- **Protein:**5 The egg yolks, and even the whites, are high in protein. The latter are known to fill in for meats that vegetarians don’t eat.

## What Is Nutritional Yeast and How Can You Benefit From It?

Also known as nooch, nutritional yeast has gained popularity as a non-animal source of protein that can be very easily digested. A low-fat and low-carbohydrate food,6 it possesses a nutty and cheese-like flavor, making it ideal as a cheese substitute. There’s more to nutritional yeast than its flavor, though, since it’s known to contain:

- All nine essential amino acids
- Vitamins A, C and E
- A whopping 14 minerals and 17 other vitamins

The compounds beta-1,3 glucan, trehalose, mannan and glutathione are also found in nutritional yeast, and these may help support healthy immune function.7 It has also shown prowess as an energy booster and post-exercise immunity enhancer, as noted in a study published in the British Journal of Nutrition.8

According to yeast expert Seymour Pomper, Ph.D., nutritional yeast has become a popular herbal monopreparation in Germany due to its potential anti-viral and antibacterial properties that can be useful for immune system stimulation and to help combat the following conditions:9

- [Candida infection](https://articles.mercola.com/yeast-infection/what-is-yeast-infection.aspx)
- Chronic acne
- Appetite loss
- [Diarrhea](https://articles.mercola.com/diarrhea.aspx)

There are concerns about nutritional yeast’s high phosphorus content, since there is a possibility that it can deplete your body’s calcium levels. Although it can be confirmed that excessive phosphorus consumption may potentially cause an imbalance in the body’s pH and levels reduce the body’s calcium levels, nutritional yeast’s phosphorus content isn’t enough to make this a concern.

If you do eat a lot of nutritional yeast daily, consume it alongside calcium-rich foods like [kale](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/kale.html) to compensate for the high phosphorus levels.
