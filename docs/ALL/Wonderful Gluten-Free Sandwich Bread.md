# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grease and line the bread pan with parchment paper.
2. Combine warm, yeast and sugar in a glass bowl. Stir & let sit 5 minutes. This allows the yeast to proof & shortens rising time.
3. In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the dry ingredients. Mix well and set aside.
4. Add the eggs, egg whites, oil and apple cider vinegar to the yeast mixture. Whisk to combine.
5. With the mixer running on low, slowly add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients.
6. Mix on medium speed for 2 minutes, scraping down the bowl if necessary.
7. Spoon the dough into the prepared bread pan. Using a spoon dipped in water, smooth the dough, spreading it into the corners of the pan.
8. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm, draft-free place for 30-40 minutes, or until dough has risen to the top of the pan.
9. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350°F. Bake bread for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the loaf is 200°F.
10. Remove bread from pan and place on a wire cooling rack immediately. Cool completely before storing in an air-tight bag.

## NOTES

I like to let my bread rise in a slightly warmed oven. Turn the oven on to 100 degrees F, and leave it on just until it gets warm (not hot) in the oven. Then turn the oven off, place the bread in the oven, and let it rise until nearly to the top of the pan (the amount of time this takes depends on how warm the environment is that the bread is rising in. Cooler temps = longer rise time). Remove the risen bread to preheat the oven before baking.

Use an instant read thermometer make sure that the bread’s internal temperature is 200°F. Under-baked bread will be gummy when you slice into it.

I generally remove the bread from the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven. I place the loaf, on its side, on a wire cooling rack. After about 10 minutes, I flip the bread to the other side. I find doing this helps the bread to keep a nicer shape once it has cooled.
