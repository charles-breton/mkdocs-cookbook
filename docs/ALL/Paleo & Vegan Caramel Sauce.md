This paleo & vegan caramel sauce is a true revelation. Healthy, dairy free and refined sugar free, it doesn’t quite seem possible – but it is. And it’s delicious. The recipe is incredibly quick and easy – 3 ingredients, 5 minutes and let’s say it’s single serving, shall we? Add a pinch of salt to make a vegan salted caramel sauce!

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 2 tbsp coconut oil
- [ ] 3/8 cup coconut cream (Note 1)
- [ ] 1/4 tsp salt optional

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small saucepan, heat the maple syrup on medium to high heat for 3 - 4 minutes until it reaches 112 - 115 ºC (234 - 239 ºF). At the beginning, the heated maple syrup will foam and form many small bubbles. After 3 - 4 minutes, the bubbles will be larger and the maple syrup will be more viscous.
2. Add 2 tbsp coconut oil and stir well. Cook for 1 minute, stirring all the time. (Be careful to not burn yourself!)
3. Add the coconut cream and stir well until the mixture becomes homogeneous. Leave on the heat for 30 seconds, then remove from heat and allow to cool. (Again: careful, it's hot!)
4. If you want to make **salted** caramel sauce, add the salt immediately after removing from the heat. I have used 1/4 tsp of salt, but you can add it little by little until it suits your taste.

## NOTES

To get coconut cream, place a can of coconut milk into the fridge overnight. Do not shake it. The coconut cream will separate from the coconut water (which is delicious in smoothies). Best results come from coconut milk brands that don't contain too many additives and stabilisers.
