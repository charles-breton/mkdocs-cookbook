- [ ] A pinch of pepper

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 210 C / 410 F.Using your hands, squeeze out the juices from the grated zucchini into a sink (or into a cup so you can use it in a smoothie later). Return the grated flesh to a mixing bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients, including the egg if using, and mix everything really well so the flavours and ingredients are well incorporated (I used my hands to do this).Place a piece of parchment/baking paper over a flat oven tray/sheet pan. Grease lightly with a dash of olive oil (this is optional if you have non-stick paper). Wet your hands and roll the meat mixture into medium-size balls (a little smaller than a table tennis ball). Place on the tray, spaced out evenly (don’t overcrowd the tray). Drizzle each meatball with a few drops of the hot sauce and place the tray in the oven (make sure it’s hot!) on the middle shelf. Bake for 18-20 minutes.Remove from the oven and serve with extra hot sauce and some lime wedges. I like to drizzle a little more hot sauce to make them glossy for presentation.
