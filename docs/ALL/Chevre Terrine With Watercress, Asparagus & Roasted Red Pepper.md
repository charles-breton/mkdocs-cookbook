Goat cheese has a light, tangy taste that goes very well with peppery watercress. Woolwich Dairy makes a 450-g log that is a terrific buy— find it at big box stores such as Costco. If you prefer a milder taste, use half chèvre and half cream cheese and substitute with chives in the middle layer instead of watercress. A slice of this terrine over lightly dressed greens makes a chic luncheon plate—serve with crusty bread. For an appetizer, place a 1-inch-thick (2.5‑cm) slice on a cool plate or wooden board for serving. Surround with pita crisps and provide a small knife for spreading.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut roasted pepper into thin ¼-inch (5‑mm) strips; all the pepper may not be needed. Snap off woody ends from asparagus; discard. Blanch spears in shallow boiling water for 2 minutes. Immediately rinse under cold running water to stop cooking; drain.
2. Line 8 x 4-inch (1.5-L) loaf pan with plastic wrap, letting ends generously hang over sides.
3. Measure out ¼ cup (60 mL) whipping cream; sprinkle with gelatin. When 10 minutes has elapsed, heat remaining ¼ cup (60 mL) cream in microwave for 25 to 30 seconds or until cream is hot or has just come to a boil. Pour hot cream into cream and gelatin mixture. Stir to dissolve gelatin completely. (If some of the gelatin crystals are still visible after generous stirring, place whole mixture in microwave for 10 seconds. Then stir well again.) Cool.
4. In a food processor, whirl cheese with lemon juice, garlic, salt and cayenne until well mixed. Scrape down sides; while running, add cream mixture. Then remove two-thirds of mixture to another bowl.
5. Chop watercress and add to remaining cheese mixture in food processor; whirl to incorporate.
6. Spread half of white cheese mixture in lined pan. Lengthwise, without touching either long side, alternately place, slightly apart, half of asparagus and red pepper strips so vegetables run from short end to short end. Spread watercress- cheese mixture evenly overtop. Lengthwise, alternately place remaining half of asparagus and red pepper strips. Evenly spread remaining white cheese mixture overtop.
7. Bring up ends of plastic over loaf; pat gently into place. Refrigerate at least 6 hours or overnight. To serve, lift set loaf from pan using plastic wrap; slice. Kept chilled, terrine keeps well for several days.
