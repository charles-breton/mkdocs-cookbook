# INSTRUCTIONS

## NOTES

#### **Notes on Sweeteners:** 

I use my own blend of xylitol, erythritol, and stevia in my recipes. This is twice as sweet as sugar. It is comparable to Trim Healthy Mama Gentle Sweet and Truvia.

To sub in Swerve or Lakanto Monk Fruit use 1.5 times the amount of sweetener called for. 

To sub in Pyure or Trim Healthy Mama Super Sweet use half the amount of sweetener called for.

Substitutions will work in most recipes. They may not work in candies, such as caramel.
