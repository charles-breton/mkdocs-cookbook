# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 4 celery sticks to make some juice (instead of filtered water and salt)
- [ ] P.S. Makes about 2 cups of juice so if salted filtered water was used use about that quantity of liquid.)
- [ ] 1 tbsp starter culture (optional) (to be mixed with the vegetable juice or the filtered water)
- [ ] 2-3 green cabbages (keep some leaves to put on top of the jars)
- [ ] 15-20 carrots  (The bacteria will digest the sugar)
- [ ] 2 golden beets
- [ ] 4-5 inches of ginger 
- [ ] 7 cloves of garlic

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Try to add fresh turmeric
2. They don't seem to put any but they mention that we can use basil, sage, rosemary, thyme, oregano. 
3. Wash the vegetables, peel and shred them. Mix evenly in a big bowl, using gloves if we have hot peppers. 
4. Add the celery juice previously mixed with the starter culture. Mix evenly (again with gloves).
5. Fill the jars, making sure the vegetables are very compacted.
6. Put the lid loosely as the fermentation process will produce some CO2 (gas) and it coud put too much pressure in the jars. 
7. Put in a cooler, close the tops and it should be ready after about 7 days.
