# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 250°F/120°C. Line a rimmed baking tray with parchment paper or a baking mat. Mix almonds, pecans, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds and flax seeds in a large bowl. Set aside. Lightly toast sesame seeds over medium/low heat for 4 to 6 minutes. Watch out they do not burn or they'll taste bitter! You know they're ready when they're lightly golden, and you press one between your fingertips and it turns to powder. Add sesame seeds, sweetener, molasses (optional) and cinnamon to a food processor and pulse a couple times until powdered and mixed thoroughly. Add sesame sugar to nut mix and combine thoroughly. Set asideBeat egg whites with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold gently into granola mix until fully combined. Spread granola onto prepared baking tray in a single layer and sprinkle with pink Himalayan salt. Bake for 45-50 minutes, until they begin to harden, checking every 15 minutes or so. Allow to cool completely, as they'll continue to crisp up while cooling. Depending on the sweetener you use, these might get their full crunch after an overnight rest (think xylitol!). Break up in chunks and store in an airtight container for up to a week, in the fridge for 2, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.

## NOTES

RECIPE NOTES*Lightly toasting the nuts and seeds lightly in a pan or skillet (or roasting for 10 minutes!) brings out the best in them! So I highly suggest you get them golden and fragrant before tossing with the mix. **I'm very fond of adding blackstrap molasses for a real brown sugar kick (and a tonne of umami!).. It adds 0.5g of carbs per serving (it's packed with nutrients), and a whole load of punch. But it’s totally optional, and you can just use your regular sweetener
