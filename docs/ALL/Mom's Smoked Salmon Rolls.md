Smoked salmon is a must on every buffet table in our family regardless of the occasion. Christmas, birthdays or Easter, smoked salmon is always one of the dishes that we eat. Due to this I’ve become a bit bored of it. It’s good, but I prefer the other dishes on the buffet table or at least prefered until my mother made these salmon rolls. Now I’ll definitly eat salmon at our next family buffet, as long it’s in shape of these delicious salmon rolls filled with creamy and biting mixture.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix cream cheese, horseradish, salt and pepper in a bowl.
2. Cover your counter with plastic wrap. Overlap the salmon slices on the plastic wrap, creating a rectangle. Spread the mixture evenly on the salmon.
3. Roll the salmon, starting at the long side until you have a roll. It can be a bit messy so just do it slowly and use the plastic wrap to help you. Put the salmon roll in the fridge for at least two hours, or over night.
4. Take out the salmon roll and cut it into pieces with a sharp knife. If the roll is too soft to cut, then put the salmon in the freezer for a while.
5. Arrange the salmon rolls on a serving plate with the cut side up. Decorate with chopped chives.
