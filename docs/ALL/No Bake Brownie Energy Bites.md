# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grind the walnuts and almonds in a food processor, until a dough starts to form. Add the dates, cocoa powder, ¼ cup shredded coconut flakes and salt and process until incorporated and the mixture begins to turn into a dough.
2. Roll the mixture into round balls using the help of saran wrap (wrap it around the bites to form a circle), until all the mixture is finished.
3. Roll the balls in the last ¼ cup shredded coconut flakes.
4. Place in the fridge for at least an hour, then enjoy!

## NOTES

This recipe is raw, gluten free and vegan. If you’re using regular dates, you may need to soak them a bit since they’re drier than Medjool dates.

HOW TO STORE  
You can store these brownie bites in the fridge in a zipped or air tight tupperware container for at least 3 weeks if the dates are fresh.
