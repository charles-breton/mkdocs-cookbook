I’m sure that many of you have already read my latest book, “Fat for Fuel” — if you haven’t yet, I encourage you to pick up your copy now, as it is one of the most important health books you will read in your life — and you’re determined to incorporate the ketogenic diet into your lifestyle. Now the challenge is: How can you make sure that the meals you prepare are keto-friendly? Well, you don’t have to worry — we’ve made it easy for you!

I’m excited to announce that renowned Australian chef and restauranteur Pete Evans and I are releasing the “Fat for Fuel Ketogenic Cookbook: Recipes and Ketogenic Keys to Health from a World-Class Doctor and an Internationally Renowned Chef” November 14. This fantastic resource offers a wide array of delectable recipes — from appetizers to main courses to snacks and sweet treats — that all follow the principles of the [ketogenic diet](https://articles.mercola.com/ketogenic-diet.aspx).

I am thrilled to have Pete onboard this project, not only because of his amazing palate and creativity in the kitchen, but also because his dedication to eating healthy, fat-burning foods is on par with my principles of achieving nutritional ketosis in order to reach optimal wellness. To give you a taste of what our cookbook will offer, Pete has shared one of his healthy recipes below. It combines the freshness of leafy greens with the rich taste of bacon, plus spices, to make a comforting and hearty soup that you can sip when the weather turns chilly. Try it today!

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Melt 2 tablespoons of coconut oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook for five minutes, or until softened. Stir in the garlic, silverbeet stems and cabbage and cook for five minutes, or until softened.
    
2. Melt the remaining oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat, add the bacon and cook until lightly golden, about four minutes on each side. Remove from the pan and drain on a paper towel.
    
3. Chop the bacon into 1-inch pieces and stir into the cooked cabbage mixture, then add the turmeric and broth. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
    
4. Stir in the leafy green part of the silverbeet and cook for another five minutes until wilted. Season with salt and pepper. To finish, stir in the parsley leaves and serve.
