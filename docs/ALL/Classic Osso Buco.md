## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 4 beef or veal shanks , about 1/2 pound each
    
- 1/2 cup flour for dredging [Arrowroot]
    
- 1 tablespoon cooking oil (I use avocado) [Duck fat]
    
- 1 tablespoon butter [Duck fat]
    
- 1/4 pound pancetta (lard salé), diced
    
- 1 medium yellow onion , finely diced
    
- 1 carrot , diced
    
- 1 celery rib , diced
    
- 2 cloves garlic , minced
    
- 1 cup dry white wine , e.g. pinot Grigio, sauvignon blanc, chardonnay
    
- 2 cups [quality chicken broth](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077KHZZVC?ie=UTF8&tag=thedargou09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=B077KHZZVC&th=1&psc=1) (we use and recommend Aneto), can also used veal stock if you have access to it. Beef broth can also be used though chicken broth tastes more "elegant" [Home made beef broth used and delicious]
    
- 1 1/2 tablespoons tomato paste [non]
    
- 1 bay leaf
    
- 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves
    
- 1 teaspoon salt
    
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    
-   
    
- **Gremolata** (optional):
    
- zest of one lemon
    
- 3 tablespoons finely minced parsley
    
- 4 cloves garlic , minced


# INSTRUCTIONS

- Pat the shanks dry with a paper towel and lightly dredge in flour, shaking off the excess.  Heat the oil and butter in a Dutch oven or medium pot and brown the shanks on both sides and transfer to a plate.  Set aside.
    
    If making the gremolata, combine the ingredients in a small bowl, cover and refrigerate until ready to use.      
    
- Add the pancetta or bacon and cook until browned, then add the onions and cook for 5-7 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the carrots, celery, and garlic and cook another 3-4 minutes until softened.  Add the wine and boil until reduced by half. Add the broth, seasonings, and tomato paste.
    
    Return the browned shanks to the pot, bring to a boil, reduce the heat to a very low simmer, cover and simmer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours (more ideally) or until the meat is fork tender.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Remove and discard the bay leaf.  
    
- Serve with creamy polenta or saffron risotto and, if using, sprinkle with gremolata. (See blog post for other serving recommendations.)
