# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat the oven to 450 F. You may or may not peel the potato. If you don't peel the potato, clean the skin.
    
2. Cut the potato into large chunks about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick.
    
3. Place the sweet potato fries onto a baking sheet and sprinkle a pinch of sea salt and ground black pepper. Next, drizzle the fries with about 1/8 cup of oil. You may add more if you wish.
    
4. Place in the oven for 15 minutes. Afterward, take them out and flip and return to oven for 10 minutes.
    
5. May take 1.5 hours to make and can serve 2 to 3 people.
