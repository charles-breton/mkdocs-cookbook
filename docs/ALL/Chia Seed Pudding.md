## PREP | COMMENTS

When chia seeds are soaked in water overnight, they take on a tapioca-like texture. Add some cinnamon or other spices and a bit of stevia, if you like, for sweetness and you'll have a pudding-like treat that can be eaten morning, no one or night.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Measure out chia seeds, coconut milk, extracts, and honey. Mix well and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or even overnight so the chia seeds absorb the moisture and become thick and gelatinous, like a pudding.
2. Spoon into a glass or parfait cup.
3. Add your favorite toppings and enjoy.
