Easy to make vegan or vegetarian 

Kaffir lime leaves are sometimes hard to find. The zest and juice of one lime can be substituted. You can make this soup without chicken, and instead of fish sauce, use vegetarian broth and Tamari.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Remove base of lemongrass stalks with a sharp knife, and discard tough outer layer
2. Chop lemongrass stalks into 2- inch pieces and toss into a blender with the chopped ginger, kaffir lime leaves, and garlic cloves.
3. Pulse a few times until the ingredients form a pulp. Add blended ingredients plus 2 cardamom pods to large stockpot over medium-high heat, cooking for 1-2 min, until fragrant.    
4. Add chicken bone broth.
5. Once it’s broiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 20-30 min, to allow flavours to infuse.
