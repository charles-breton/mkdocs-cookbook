# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Begin by roasting the butternut squash in an oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 45 to 70 minutes or until the squash is tender and you can poke a fork through the flesh.
2. Once the butternut squash has finished roasting, set aside to cool. Scoop squash from it's shell, removing seeds and membranes. Cut up half the squash and put it in a small pot. Pour bone broth into the pot until it almost reaches the top of the butternut squash. Add chopped garlic. Turn heat to high until it almost starts to boil, then turn heat to medium-low.
3. Once the squash is mushy enough to be able to puree, turn off the heat. Use a potato masher or a hand blender to puree. Once it is smooth, add the coconut oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper and mix with a spoon until the coconut oil has melted. Then mix again with the hand blender until smooth.

## TIPS

Most recipes suggest cutting the squash in half and scooping out the seeds and membrane then brushing it with oil and placing it in the oven to roast it. To save time, just put the whole squash in the oven for the same amount of time, then feel when the squash is soft when you squeeze it with an oven mitt to know when it’s done. Once it’s done, let it cool, then slice in half and scoop out the seeds and membrane. Either way will work for this recipe.
