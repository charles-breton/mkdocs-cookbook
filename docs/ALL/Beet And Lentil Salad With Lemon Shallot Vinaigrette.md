# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make the beets: Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.
    
2. Roast the beets: Create a large enough piece of foil to make a “boat” to steam roast. Lay the same size piece of parchment paper on top of the foil. Place the beets inside the foil/parchment paper. Add the beets, vegetable broth, lemon juice, thyme, and a pinch of salt. Wrap the beets so they have steam within the tin foil and tighten the edges.
    
3. Place the beet package on a large parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread out red onion slices on the pan, next to the beets (they stay outside of the foil so they get crispy). Cook for about 45–60 minutes (environ 1 1/2 heure pour moi)(depending on the size of the beets). Check onions halfway through and move them around if it appears that the onions around the outer edges of the baking sheet are browning and getting more crispy then the onions toward the center of the baking sheet. The beets are done when they are fork–tender. When done, allow to cool in the bag. This will help the skins loosen up for peeling (optional).
    
4. In the meantime, while the beets and onions are cooking, prepare the Lemon Shallot Vinaigrette: Add all dressing ingredients from the garlic to the salt and pepper, if using, to a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth.
    
5. Taste and adjust the ingredients to your liking (more lemon for acid, more date paste for sweetness, or more tahini for creaminess).
    
6. Once finished cooking, remove the beets and onions from the oven. If desired, carefully remove the skins of the beets, then cut into quarters or slices (your preference).
    
7. Assemble your salad: Split all ingredients between two plates or bowls (salad greens, lentils, Crunchy Candied Walnuts (link in Chef’s Notes), beets, and onions.
    
8. Pour the desired amount of salad dressing over the top.
    
9. Top with fresh ground black pepper if desired.

## NOTES

_Prep ahead_ Make the [Crunchy Candied Walnuts](https://foodrevolution.org/recipes/crunchy-candied-walnuts/) (see recipe below) ahead of time and store in the refrigerator for up to a month.
  
Make the beets ahead of time and store in the refrigerator for 7–10 days.
  
Make the dressing ahead of time and store in the refrigerator for 7–10 days.
  
_Substitutions_ Instead of lentils, use your favorite legume or one that you have on hand.
  
Instead of mixed greens, try butter lettuce, romaine, or organic kale.
  
Instead of thyme, use rosemary or oregano with the roasted and steamed beets.
  
In place of walnuts, try chopped pistachios, almonds, pecans, or hazelnuts.
  
_Date paste_ Make your own date paste using [this recipe](https://foodrevolution.org/recipes/super-simple-homemade-date-paste/). (see below)

_Onion options_ Steam the onions: If desired, you can steam the onions with the beets. You’ll just need a little extra foil and parchment to ensure you can close the foil over both the onions and beets. The onions will turn purple from the beets and take on some beet flavor. They’ll also have a soft texture as opposed to the crunchy texture from dry roasting.

Use raw onions instead of roasted or steamed (this is also delicious and good for those of you who love raw onion flavor).
