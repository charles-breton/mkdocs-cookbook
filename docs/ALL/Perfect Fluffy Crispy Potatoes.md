- [ ] _1 tablespoon dried basil or other herb(s)_

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Peel the potatoes and chop into large bite size pieces. Place them all in a pot and just barely cover with cold water, then bring it all to a boil. Once the water/potatoes are boiling, continue boiling for another 4 minutes. Drain. Throw all the par-boiled potatoes back in the drained pot and sprinkle on the rest of the ingredients. Put the lid on the pot and shake it up with both hands (wear oven mitts if the pot is still hot!), so the potatoes get covered in the spices and herbs and also get fluffy or "marred" around the edges. Put all the potatoes on a lined baking sheet and bake for 20-30 minutes or until they are browned on the outside.
