## PREP

- ▢1 [large onion](https://www.target.com/p/red-onion-each/-/A-14917313?aflt=plt) diced
- ▢1-2 inch [fresh ginger](https://www.target.com/p/ginger-root-6oz/-/A-23974827?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) minced
- ▢2 [large garlic cloves](https://www.target.com/p/spice-world-fresh-whole-garlic-3ct-bag/-/A-14917318?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) minced
- ▢1 tbsp [oil](https://amzn.to/3H4ef0z)
- ▢1 [bell pepper](https://www.target.com/p/tri-colored-bell-peppers-16oz-3ct-good-38-gather-8482-packaging-may-vary/-/A-78832378?aflt=plt) diced
- ▢2 [medium zucchini](https://www.target.com/p/organic-zucchini-2ct/-/A-85825253?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) diced
- ▢1 small eggplant diced
- ▢1 [tomato](https://www.target.com/p/beefsteak-tomatoes-13oz-2ct-good-38-gather-8482-packaging-may-vary/-/A-82628083?aflt=plt#lnk=sametab) diced (optional)
- ▢4-5 tbsp [soy sauce](https://amzn.to/3bYdOX6) I used Bragg’s liquid aminos
- ▢1 tbsp [rice vinegar](https://amzn.to/3bZoxRj)
- ▢3 tbsp [maple syrup or honey](https://amzn.to/3037uLo) [coconut sugar]
- ▢[Ground black pepper](https://amzn.to/3kH0r2D) to taste
- ▢Pinch [red pepper flakes](https://amzn.to/3qnZXSC)
- ▢4 green onion sprigs finely chopped


# INSTRUCTIONS

- Cook rice as per package instructions. I usually make [Instant Pot brown rice](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-brown-rice/).
    
- While rice is cooking, preheat wok or large deep non-stick skillet on medium heat. Add ground beef and cook breaking into pieces and stirring constantly, for about 5-7 minutes. Drain fat if desired. I have to say I used [Instant Pot frozen ground beef](https://ifoodreal.com/instant-pot-frozen-ground-beef-turkey/), so I cooked it less time. It is a miracle recipe!
    
- Towards the end of browning ground beef, add onion, ginger and garlic. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove beef onto plate and return skillet to the stove.
    
- Swirl oil to coat, add bell pepper and saute for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add zucchini, eggplant and tomato; saute for another 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    
- Add soy sauce, rice vinegar,  maple syrup, pepper and red pepper flakes. Stir and cook for 1 minute. Add cooked beef and stir. Turn off the heat and sprinkle with green onion; stir again.
    
- Fluff rice with a fork and serve Korean ground beef over it.

## NOTES

Truth is you can use any ground meat, like ground turkey or chicken.

Other firm veggies: Like cabbage, broccoli or even cauliflower. Whatever you have on hand.

Tomato: It is optional, so if you have one on hand. I like how it holds its juiciness, soft texture and freshness while other veggies become more cooked.

Optional additions: You can also add cashews, water chestnuts, shredded carrots. Possibilities are endless!

Fresh garlic or ginger substitutes: If missing fresh, use 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp ground ginger respectively.

Serving Ideas

With whole grain side: The first time I made it, I served it over brown rice. Second time with quinoa. Third time with brown rice noodles.

Lettuce wraps: Make it as an appetizer and serve on lettuce leaves as a wrap.

Korean "tacos": Wrap Korean style ground beef in flour tortillas and add shredded cabbage and make “tacos”. Then garnish with red garlic chili sauce.

Low carb meal: For low carb dinner serve over cauliflower rice.




- **Store:** Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Store beef and veggies mix separately from rice, so the grain doesn’t soak up all delicious juices. Reheat in a skillet with a splash of water or broth, simmering on low while covered, stir occasionally. 
- **Freeze**: If it contains zucchini. do not freeze. If you used more sturdy veggies like broccoli, cauliflower and eggplant, then it’s fine. Freeze in an airtight container for up to 3 months. Thaw in the fridge overnight.
- **Ground beef:** I used organic hamburger with 85% fat. Truth is you can use any ground meat, like ground turkey or chicken.
- **Other firm veggies:** Like cabbage, broccoli or even cauliflower. Whatever you have on hand.
- **Tomato:** It is optional, so if you have one on hand. I like how it holds its juiciness, soft texture and freshness while other veggies become more cooked.
- **Optional additions:** You can also add cashews, water chestnuts, shredded carrots. Possibilities are endless!
- **Fresh garlic or ginger substitutes:** If missing fresh, use 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp ground ginger respectively.
