On St. Patrick’s Day, our family always has a lot of fun. The naughty leprechaun comes to visit, sometimes he leaves us treats and gold coins, other times he just makes messes all around the house. Someone is always being pinched. We usually eat entirely green in our family for the whole day.

Breakfast might be whole-grain-pioneer-blender-pancakes colored green by adding spinach to the batter, with honeydew and green grapes on the side. For lunch a green salad with a green goddess avocado and chive dressing is always in order. For an afternoon snack, I bust out the greenest smoothie you’ve ever seen. Dinner is a whole green affair: an appetizer of celery, cucumber, broccoli and green olives in edamame and avocado hummus. Main course might consist of spinach fettuccine with green cashew Alfredo (spinach is the star again!) topped with basil chiffonade. And definitely THIS very green ice cream for dessert. St. Patrick’s Day is still a few months away, but it’s always good to get more green days in throughout the year.

# INGREDIENTS

1 can full-fat coconut milk
  
1 cup almond milk (other nut or seed milks work too)
  
¼ cup raw almond butter
  
2 cup packed organic baby spinach
  
⅔ cup raw agave OR pure maple syrup

⅓ cup shelled pistachios, roughly chopped
  
1 teaspoon almond extract
  
*You can follow this recipe to make your own coconut and almond milk and be absolutely certain of rawness. It’ll be 1 1/2 cups of coconut milk in that case.*

# INSTRUCTIONS

Method: In your blender, blend everything except for the pistachios until fully combined, about one to two minutes. There should be no visible spinach pieces! Pour into prepared ice cream maker and let churn for twenty-five to thirty minutes; add pistachios during the last few minutes of churning. You can eat it straight away like soft serve, but for the best texture and flavor, pour ice cream into an airtight container and freeze for two hours or overnight before serving. If you don’t have an ice cream maker, you can try this method.
