# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In large bowl, whisk together egg white, ginger, garlic, sesame oil, soy sauce, salt and pepper. Add pork, carrot, green onions and coriander; mix together with hands until well combined.
2. Place 4 wonton wrappers on work surface, keeping remainder covered with damp cloth to prevent drying out; brush lightly with water. Place scant 1 tbsp (15 mL) pork mixture in centre of each; gather edges of wrapper and fold up like flower petals around filling, leaving 1-inch (2.5 cm) opening at top. Holding dumpling just under opening, tap on counter to flatten bottom. Repeat with remaining wrappers. _(Make-ahead: Cover and refrigerate for up to 4 hours.)_
3. In wok or steamer, bring 2 inches (5 cm) water to boil. Line steamer tray with waxed paper; arrange dumplings, without touching, on paper. Place over wok; cover and steam, adding more water as necessary, until dumplings are firm, about 5 minutes. Repeat with any remaining dumplings. Place coriander leaf on top of each.
4. **Dipping Sauce:** In small bowl, mix vinegar with soy sauce; serve with dumplings.
