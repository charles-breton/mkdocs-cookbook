_A perfect fit in my favorite bakeware, [Revol Les Naturels](http://www.revol1768.com/us/43-les-naturels), as **[seen in Williams-Sonoma](http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/revol-porcelain-tartlet-pans/?cm_src=AutoRel)**. These are the toxin-free [Tartlet Pans](http://www.revol1768.com/us/ramekins-and-souffles/118-les-naturels-set-of-2-tartlet-pans.html) in Cream and Sesame Grey, which are sized just right (4-1/2 inches in diameter) for making spot on burger buns to fit both veggie burgers and meat patties._

## PREP | COMMENTS

30 mins (does not include rising and cooling)
Cook time 15 mins
Total time 45 mins
Serves: 4 gluten free hamburger buns [For six "taller" or more normal fluffier buns, double the entire recipe and make 6 buns. You will need to extend the cooking time slightly, to about 18 to 20 minutes.]

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ]   ⅓ cup + 2 tablespoons warm water (scant ½ cup)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon honey (can sub agave nectar)
- [ ] ¾ teaspoon active dry yeast (use 1 teaspoon in low altitude / damp climates)
- [ ] ⅓ cup brown or white rice flour*
- [ ] ⅓ cup tapioca starch
- [ ] ¼ cup arrowroot starch (can sub another starch, if needed)
- [ ] ¼ cup sorghum flour*
- [ ] 1 teaspoon xanthan gum
- [ ] ½ teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1 egg
- [ ] 1 ½ tablespoons olive, rice bran, or grapeseed oil (I use Ellyndale oils)
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon apple cider vinegar
- [ ] ½ teaspoon sesame seeds

# INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Add the water, honey and yeast to a large mixing bowl, whisk once and let sit 5 minutes. If your yeast is still active, it should be a little foamy / bubbly.
2. Place the flours, starches, xanthan gum, and salt in a medium bowl and whisk to combine.
3. Add the egg, oil and vinegar to the yeast mixture and whisk to combine. Add the dry ingredients and blend with a mixer for 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides and blend on medium speed for about 2 minutes. It will be like a very sticky dough or thick batter.
4. Scrape the dough into four greased and floured molds** - I use Revol Tartlet Pans, which are perfectly sized for most burgers at 4½ inches in diameter. Alternately, you can make your own molds with tin foil. Even out the dough with damp hands. Sprinkle the tops with the sesame seeds.
5. Let rise, uncovered, in a warm place for 1 hour. I place them in my oven with the oven light on (remember to remove them before preheating though!).
6. Preheat your oven to 375ºF. Bake the buns for 15 to 17 minutes, or until golden on top.
7. Let cool for 15 minutes before removing them from the molds. For optimal slicing, let cool for another 10 minutes on a wire rack. Slice and toast for your burger!

## NOTES

that the prep time does not include rising and cooling.

*I found the flours to be quite interchangeable. When I didn't have any rice flour on hand, I used sorghum flour for the rice flours and used either millet or quinoa flour in place of the sorghum flour. If using quinoa flour at all, I recommend increasing the sweetener to 1½ tablespoons as it does add notable bitterness if the sweetener is not increased.

**The mixture is quite sticky but thick enough that you might be able to bake it free-form (I haven't tried this yet) without it spreading too much. Plop four mounds onto a parchment or silicone mat-lined baking sheet and shape them with damp hands to rounds that are just over 4 inches in diameter.
