# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper or prepare by greasing. (I use baking stones that require no pre-treating)
3. In a heavy saucepan over medium heat, whisk together the coconut milk, sweetener, and salt.
4. Add flour and stir completely
5. Heat the mixture to a full boil and simmer for about two minutes or until thickened (if making chocolate version, add 2 tablespoons cocoa powder to the mixture)
6. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla and coconut.
7. Drop mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls onto the baking sheet. I used a cookie scoop to make things quick and less messy (and it makes nicely shaped macaroons, too :-)!)
8. Bake for about 16 minutes, or until golden brown.
9. Cool on cookie sheet for a few minutes, then transfer to cooling rack.
