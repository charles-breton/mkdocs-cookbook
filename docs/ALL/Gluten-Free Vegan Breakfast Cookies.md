## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

    •    2 medium ripe bananas

    •    2 batches flax eggs (2 Tbsp (14 g) flaxseed meal + 5 Tbsp (75 ml) water as original recipe is written)

    •    1/2 cup natural, salted peanut butter (crunchy or smooth)

    •    2 Tbsp refined coconut oil (melted // or avocado oil)

    •    1 tsp pure vanilla extract

    •    3 Tbsp agave nectar or maple syrup (or honey if not vegan)

    •    1 1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats

    •    1/2 cup oat flour (ground from GF oats)

    •    1/2 cup almond meal (ground from raw almonds)

    •    1/2 tsp baking powder

    •    1/2 tsp baking soda

    •    1 pinch sea salt (add more or less depending on saltiness of your PB)

    •    3 Tbsp raw walnuts (lightly crushed // or sub other nut)

    •    1/2 cup dairy-free semisweet or dark chocolate chips


# INSTRUCTIONS

    •    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C).

    •    In a large bowl combine flax seed and water and let rest for 5 minutes to achieve "eggy" texture.

    •    Mash in the bananas until well combined, and then add peanut butter, baking powder, baking soda, melted coconut oil, agave nectar, salt, vanilla and stir.

    •    Add oats, almond meal and oat flour and mix well.

    •    Add chocolate chips and walnuts and stir until well combined. Refrigerate for 5 minutes to harden.

    •    Drop cookies by spoonfuls on a lightly greased baking sheet - they won't expand much. Also make them as uniform in size as possible to ensure even baking.

    •    Bake for 15-17 minutes or until the cookies are slightly golden brown.

    •    Let rest on baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring to a cooling rack. After completely cooled, store in an air-tight container to keep fresh for up to a few days. Refrigerate or freeze for even longer storage time.
