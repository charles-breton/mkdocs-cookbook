# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Melt ghee (or butter) in a microwave safe ramekin or other container, about 4" in diameter with a flat bottom. This takes about 30 seconds.
    
2. Add the remaining ingredients and stir until well combined. Let sit for a minute to allow the mixture to thicken.
    
3. Microwave for about 90 seconds, until firm. Run a knife along the edge and flip over a plate to release. Slice in half, then toast in the toaster.

## NOTES

- Nutrition facts below are for a LARGE low carb English muffin (4" diameter). To make a regular sized one, use 2/3 to 3/4 of the recipe and a smaller container.
    
- If you prefer more/smaller slices, you can also make it in a mug instead of a ramekin, then just pop those in the toaster in batches.
    
- A reader suggested using [these rectangular Pyrex containers](https://www.wholesomeyum.com/product/B00JJILWQ0/US/wholyum-20/?cart=y) for this recipe. If you use one of those and then cut it in half, you'll get the perfect size for a sandwich!
