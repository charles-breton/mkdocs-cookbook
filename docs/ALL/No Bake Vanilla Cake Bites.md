# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add pitted dates to a food processor and mix until small bits remain or a ball forms. Remove from food processor and set aside.    
2. To the food processor, add the walnuts, almond flour, coconut flour, and sea salt. Blend until a semi-fine meal is achieved. Add dates back in (in bite-sized pieces) as well as the vanilla extract. Pulse until a loose dough forms. Be careful not to over-blend. You're looking for a pliable dough, not a purée.     
3. Scoop out 2-Tablespoon amounts using a cookie scooper (like this one) and roll into balls with hands or release lever on scoop and place directly on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat until all dough is used up.     
4. Roll in finely shredded coconut or leave as is. Store in refrigerator or freezer. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month. You could also press the "dough" into a loaf or 8x8-inch cake pan and slice into bars.
