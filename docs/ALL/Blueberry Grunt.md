# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 400F. In a large saucepan, combine blueberries, 3/4 cup sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, nutmeg and cinnamon. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer 5 minutes. Place in a 8 cup (2L) baking dish.

2. Meanwhile, in a bowl, combine flour, baking powder, remaining 1 tbsp sugar and salt. Cut in cold butter until mixtures resembles coarse oatmeal. Stir in just enough milk, about 1 cup, to make a soft dough.
  
3. Divide dough in 8 equal portions and place them, evenly spaced, on blueberry mixture. Bake until biscuits are firm and no longer doughy and blueberries have thickened slightly, 20 to 25 minutes.
  
4. To serve, place a biscuit in each serving dish. Spoon blueberries on top, and add a scoop of ice cream on the side.
