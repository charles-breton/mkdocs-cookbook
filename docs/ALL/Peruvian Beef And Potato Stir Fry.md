People are often surprised to learn that Peruvian cuisine has a strong Chinese influence. A large Chinese immigrant community in Lima has given rise to a unique fusion of Incan, European and Asian cuisine called _chifa_ cooking. _Lomo saltado_, a stir fry of beef and French fries over rice, is the ultimate example.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut the beef against the grain into strips about 2 inches long and 1/4 inch thick. Get all of your ingredients ready and close at hand. Prepare the French fries and rice and keep hot.
    
2. Heat the oil over high flame in a large pot or wok until it shimmers. Add the beef and stir fry until it is just cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove to a plate and set aside.
    
3. Add more oil to the pot or wok if needed and return it to high heat. Add the onion, peppers and garlic and stir fry until the onion is cooked through, but still a little crunchy, 2 to 3 minutes.
    
4. Add the tomatoes, soy sauce, vinegar, salt and pepper and stir fry for about 1 minute more. Return the beef to the pot or wok, along with the French fries and toss everything together to heat through and mingle the flavors. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper.
    
5. Place a big scoop of rice on each diner's plate and serve the _lomo saltado_ over the rice.

#### **Variations**

- Versions of _lomo saltado_ vary widely. Try seasoning the dish with some ground cumin, oregano, chopped parsley or chopped cilantro. Omit the vinegar or substitute a squeeze of lemon juice.
    
- _Ajís amarillos_ chiles lend a unique, especially Peruvian, flavor to this dish. Other chiles (jalapeño, serrano) can be used, but the flavor won't be the same. Or just use a red or green bell pepper for a mild dish.
    
- Try adding a shot or two of pisco brandy at the end and flame it for a dramatic finale.
