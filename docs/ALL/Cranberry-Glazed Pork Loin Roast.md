# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small saucepan, stir together all ingredients except roast. Cook, stirring over medium heat, until thickened. Set aside.
2. Place the roast in a shallow baking dish. Roast at 325F for 45 minutes. Spoon 1/2 cup sauce over roast and continue roasting 30-45 minutes or until internal temperature is 155-165F. Let stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Serve with remaining sauce. Yield: 8 servings.

## NOTES

I will often double the sauce recipe because I have run out at times. And I will double the amount of rind called for (1 tsp in single recipe, 2 tsp in a double recipe).
