# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees F.**
2. **Chop off the top and the ends of the carrots and gently rinse with water, removing any dirt. Roughly chop the carrot into big pieces to roast.**
3. **Place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet and spread out carrot pieces, gently drizzle olive oil over and sprinkle with sea salt. Allow to roast for 25-30 minutes (depending on how large your pieces are). The carrots will be finished when a fork can go through the middle with ease. Set aside and allow to fully cool.**
4. **Ensure the cashews have been soaked overnight, drain and rinse. Once the carrots are cooled, chop into bite-size pieces.**
5. **Place all ingredients together in a high-speed food processor and blend on high, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. Taste to adjust seasoning.**
6. **Store in the fridge for up to 5 days.**
7. **Serve with cucumber curls or vegetables!**
