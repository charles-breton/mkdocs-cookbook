# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Shred all the vegetables.
2. Juice celery to create a brine, 1 cup for every quart of vegetables.
3. Add 1/4 teaspoon of Kinetic Culture to the brine. Pour the brine over the shredded vegetables and mix in a large bowl to distribute evenly over all vegetables.
4. Pack into jar, compressing vegetables with a masher to remove air pockets. Vegetables should fill jar to the very top. Add more vegetables if needed to reach the top of the jar.
5. Top off with a cabbage leaf, tucking the edges of the leaf into the sides so all vegetables are under it.
6. Add Dr. Mercola’s Jar Lid to top of the jar, leaving it slightly cracked open.
7. Ferment at approximately 72 degrees for three to four days.
8. When the vegetables reach desired taste and texture, store in the refrigerator.

## NOTES

In the winter, it may take longer if surrounding temperature is colder. A temperature-stable environment (such as inside an empty cooler) is recommended.
