# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pat your pork belly dry. (if your belly has really thick skin, you may want to score the top first) Season with salt, pepper and just a sprinkle of brown sugar on all sides. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
2. Add to marinade and allow it to sit for 15 minutes.
3. remove from marinade, reserve excess marinade (place in refrigerator) and preheat your oven to 325 degrees F.
4. Heat a pan, add in just a bit of oil and sear until a nice crust forms on each side. Yes it will smoke a bit, just keep going, the taste is worth the smoke.
5. Once you have a beautiful crust on all sides, place belly in a dish with just a covering of stock and roast, tented in foil for 2-3 hours or until done to your liking. Check on it every 30 minutes and add just a bit more stock if necessary to keep pork from burning the dish.
6. Remove from oven, place pork belly bites in a pan, cover with reserved marinade and simmer until the mixture is bubbly and the belly is coated with the sauce.

#### **For Jalapeno Cole Slaw**
    
7. Combine dressing ingredients in a mason jar and shake vigorously until emulsified. Taste and adjust for sweetness and heat) Just before serving, toss coleslaw & jalapenos with the dressing. let sit for 5 minutes. Plate, top with pork belly & serve.
