## NOTES

JL: I pan fry the dumplings in a non-stick skillet with a dash of veg oil and three to four cloves of crushed garlic. 

When both side are golden brown, add half cup of water, put a lid on to help steam the dumplings for a minute [this prevent the dumplings from getting too dry and hard].
