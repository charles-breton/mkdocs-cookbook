# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees and prepare a standard loaf pan (8.5x4.5 or 9x5) by lining with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, mash the bananas well, and, either by hand or with an electric mixer, whisk together the mashed bananas and eggs. Add the coconut sugar, coconut milk, coconut oil, and vanilla extract and mix until smooth and incorporated.
3. In a smaller bowl combine the cassava flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Slowly stir the dry mixture into the wet to fully combine and don't overmix. Batter will be thick.
4. Slowly pour all of the batter into the parchment-lined loaf pan, scraping the sides of the bowl with a spatula to use all the batter.
5. Smooth out the top, and bake in the middle of the preheated oven for 1 hour - 1 hour 15 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out mainly clean (crumbs are okay.) Regarder à 50 minutes avec notre four.
6. Remove from oven and let sit for 5 minutes, then transfer the entire loaf (in the parchment paper is fine) to a wire rack to cool completely for at least an hour. After cooling, slice and serve!
7. Enjoy!
