This terrine is a delicious stacked “salad.” Or cut into small squares, dab with garlicky mayonnaise and serve nestled in bib lettuce as a light nibble with drinks. Plated with greens, it makes a pretty lunch (Vegetable Terrine Salad, below).

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line an 8 x 4-inch (1.5-L) loaf pan with plastic wrap, generously overhanging at each end. Leave peppers whole for grilling. Cut zucchini lengthwise into 6 slices.
2. Preheat barbecue until hot. If grill is not well-seasoned, lightly oil or coat with high-heat cooking spray.
3. Meanwhile, clean and thinly slice leek, using only white and light green portion. Sliced, there should be about 2 cups (500 mL). Thinly slice mushrooms.
4. Heat oil in medium frying pan over medium heat until hot. Add leeks; sauté 3 to 4 minutes or until wilting. Add mushrooms and garlic; stir and cover for 5 minutes. Then transfer leek mixture to a colander or sieve; let drain while proceeding.
5. Grill whole peppers for 16 to 20 minutes or until softened and skins are blackened in places. Grill zucchini slices until they have brown hatch marks, from 6 to 8 minutes per side. As removed, stack in a tray so slices steam a bit. Place peppers on tray with zucchini; cover all with foil to steam. After about 15 minutes, uncover, peel and seed peppers, leaving flesh in large pieces.
6. Measure ½ cup (125 mL) tomato juice into a bowl. Sprinkle with gelatine packet and also additional 1 tsp (5 mL); stir briefly and let stand 5 minutes or more. Measure out remaining ¾ cup (175 mL) juice. Covering with plastic wrap, turn back one edge to vent and heat for 1 to 2 minutes in microwave until almost boiling. Pour into gelatin mixture; stir until gelatin is completely dissolved. Then stir in lemon juice, oregano, salt and pepper.
7. Cutting to fit as needed, place a layer of red pepper, smooth-side down, in bottom of lined pan. (Save pepper cuttings.) Drizzle peppers in pan with 2 to 3 tbsp (30 to 45 mL) of tomato juice. Top with a layer of 3 zucchini strips; drizzle with 2 to 3 tbsp (30 to 45 mL) of tomato juice. Add a layer of all of mushroom and leeks; drizzle with ¼ cup (60 mL) tomato juice. Top with a layer of remaining zucchini strips; drizzle with 2 to 3 tbsp (30 to 45 mL) of tomato juice.
8. Finally, cutting to fit, top with yellow pepper, placing smooth-side up; pour all remaining juice overtop. (Save pepper cuttings.) Lift filled pan slightly off counter; let drop to settle contents. Holding edges of plastic wrap taut, insert a dull knife between vegetables and plastic wrap so tomato juice flows down all sides (within plastic of course!) Cover terrine with more plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least half a day.
9. Take grilled pepper cuttings and finely dice; refrigerate. When ready to serve, place a serving platter overtop terrine. Turn upside down; gently remove all plastic wrap. Cut into 8 thick slices while still icy cold from fridge. Use a large flat spatula to transport slices onto serving plates. Garnish with diced peppers. Terrine keeps well for 2 or more days.
