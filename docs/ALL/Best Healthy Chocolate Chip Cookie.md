## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

    •    2 cups blanched almond flour

    •    1 tsp baking powder

    •    1/4 cup arrowroot starch can substitute for cornstarch

    •    2 tbsp coconut oil

    •    6 tbsp sticky sweetener of choice * See notes

    •    1 tsp almond extract

    •    1/4 cup milk of choice I used unsweetened coconut milk

    •    1/2 cup chocolate chips of choice


# INSTRUCTIONS

    •    Preheat oven to 175C/350F. Line a large cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

    •    In a large mixing bowl, add all your dry ingredients and mix well. 

    •    In a microwave-safe bowl or stovetop, melt your coconut oil with your sticky sweetener and almond extract. Add to the dry mixture, along with your milk of choice and mix very well. Stir through your chocolate chips.

    •    Lightly wet your hands and form small balls out of the cookie dough. Place the balls on the lined cookie sheet. Press each ball into a cookie shape. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until just brown. 

    •    Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the pan completely.
