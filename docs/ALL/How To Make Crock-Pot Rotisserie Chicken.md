# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pat chicken completely dry with paper towels, and then truss with or without string, as it will prevent the chicken from falling apart in the crockpot.
2. Combine the remaining ingredients together in a small bowl until it forms a paste.
3. Rub the paste all over the chicken, including the inside.
4. Place the onion halves in the bottom of the crockpot to create a rack for the chicken to sit on.
5. Place the chicken in the crockpot, breast side up.
6. Cover and cook on low for eight to nine hours.
7. Carefully remove from the slow cooker and place on a baking sheet. Cook for five to seven minutes in a 450-degree F oven to crisp the skin, but watch the chicken carefully to prevent burning.

## Skip Store-Bought Rotisserie Chicken and Make a Homemade Version Instead

According to Purdue University’s Avian Sciences Club, Americans consume roughly 8 billion chickens annually.1 This isn’t surprising at all, given that chicken is a versatile entree that pairs well with various ingredients, and can be cooked in different ways.

Rotisserie chicken is a favorite of many, and some grocery stores and supermarkets have capitalized on this by selling these ready-to-eat chickens. But while buying store-bought chickens can save preparation and cooking time, especially during the very busy holiday season, homemade rotisserie chicken is a better option, especially since the following risks have been linked to commercial rotisserie chicken:

- Store-bought chickens are cooked using processed vegetable oils that can decrease your body’s stores of valuable [omega-3 fats](https://articles.mercola.com/omega-3.aspx) and raise your risk for cardiovascular disease.
- A Business Insider article revealed that rotisserie chicken sold in Costco is highly processed and contains alarmingly high amounts of sodium, as the birds are usually injected with a saline solution.2
- Fox News LA reports that rotisserie chickens are prone to bacterial contamination, particularly once a chicken’s internal temperature falls below 140 degrees F.3
- Rotisserie chickens are not as “fresh” as they appear to be. A Mother Jones report highlighted that supermarkets often take unsold and nearly expired chickens from the butcher section and cook them. This move is done solely for profit — the supermarket earns more money by selling cooked items, compared to simply throwing the food out.4

Another advantage of making homemade rotisserie chicken is it allows you to get your creative and culinary juices flowing. You’re given an opportunity to tweak the amount of seasonings you add to the dish, depending on your or your guests’ preferences, and experiment with new herb and spice blends that you’ve always wanted to try.

## Pasture-Raised Chicken: Why This Type of Chicken Is Highly Ideal

When cooking rotisserie chicken, or any chicken dish for that matter, purchase pasture-raised chickens from a local farmer in your area, farmers market or food co-op. Most chickens sold in grocery stores and supermarkets are grown in [concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/truth-about-factory-farms.htm) located across different states. There are many issues that hound CAFOs in the U.S. today, and these are the most common, according to the Cornucopia Institute:5

- Unethical treatment of chickens by confining them in cages and forbidding them to roam on pasture
- Addition of unhealthy substances in chicken feeds, such as antibiotics, that promote unnatural growth and decrease nutrient levels in the animals
- Increased land, air and water pollution in places around CAFOs
- Increased transmission of infectious diseases and antibiotic-resistant superbugs

Buying organic, pasture-raised chicken not only will allow you to reap higher amounts of healthy fats and vitamins, but also will support livelihoods of farmers offering nutrient-dense and high-quality products. By doing so, you are allowing your purchases to make a stand against profit-hungry and environmentally destructive CAFOs.
