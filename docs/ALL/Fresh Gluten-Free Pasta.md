# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 2 cups all purpose gluten free flour such as cup4cup, plus more for dusting [the flour seems very important, 1st time buy it and weigh 2 cups to be precise and then see the recipe below.]
- [ ] 4 eggs
- [ ] 1 egg yolk
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt [for the boiling water]

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the flour in a medium bowl and create a well in the center. Add the eggs and egg yolk into the well. Using a fork break up the eggs, slowly starting to mix the flour into the eggs a little at a time. When the mixture forms a rough dough, pour the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and kneed for a 2 to 3 minutes to bring it together. Cut into 4 pieces and wrap three of them tightly with plastic wrap.
2. Dust the the first piece of dough with gluten free flour and flatten slightly with the heel of your hand. Be generous with the flour. Using a pasta roller set on the thickest number, roll the pasta into a sheet. Dust with additional flour as needed. Fold the sheet in thirds and press down. Put the dough through the roller another time. Repeat this two more times. Be patient with this step. The dough may crack slightly but the more you fold it and put it through the roller dusted with flour, the smoother it will get. Slowly start to reduce the thickness of the roller until you reach the desired thickness of the pasta. (We prefer the number 4 or 5 on our roller) Cut the sheet into desired pasta shape and length. Continue with the remaining dough.
3. Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Season generously with salt. Add the pasta and cook for 1 ½ to 2 minutes or until the pasta is al dente. Serve tossed with parmesan cheese and your favorite pasta sauce.
