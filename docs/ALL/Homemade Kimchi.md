# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] ¾ wombok cabbage
- [ ] Salt
- [ ] 3 tablespoons Korean red pepper powder (sold in Asian markets)

- [ ] 1 large clove garlic, finely minced

- [ ] 3 tablespoons water
- [ ] 2 shallots (green part only), chopped

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Chop the wombok cabbage into quarters lengthwise and remove the core. Slice the cabbage into about 2 to 3 cm thick strips, and place the cabbage in a large bowl. Salt the cabbage and massage it with your hands, until it begins to soften.
    
2. Cover the cabbage with water and allow it to soak for at least one hour.
    
3. Keep ¼ cup of the salty water that the cabbage is soaking in. Place the cabbage in a colander or large strainer, rinse it well in water, and drain it.
    
4. Rinse the bowl that the cabbage was soaked in and place the cabbage back in the bowl after it has drained.
    
5. To make the paste combine the red pepper powder, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, and water in the small mixing bowl and mix well. Add in the chopped shallots and mix. 
    
6. Add the kimchi paste to the cabbage and mix it into the cabbage. (Using clean hands may be the easiest way to do this.)
    
7. Using your hands, put the cabbage into a large glass jar, pressing the cabbage down firmly with each handful. The idea is to remove as much oxygen as possible to create the correct environment for the fermentation to occur.
    
8. Wipe the sides of the jar down and place the kimchi in a warm spot to ferment. The kimchi may need about three days to ferment, but taste it often and allow the kimchi to continue fermenting until your desired taste is achieved.
