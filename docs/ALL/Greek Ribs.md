# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut the pork into individual ribs, trimming off excess fat.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together all the remaining ingredients. Add the ribs and mix so they are all coated. Put the ribs into a large ziploc bag (freezer variety is heavier and less likely to leak). Pour in any remaining liquid. Squeeze out the excess air and seal tightly.
3. Refrigerate, turning the bag occasionally, for at least 8 hours to a maximum of 24 hours.
4. Arrange the ribs on a rack in a large foil-lined roasting pan. Pour the marinade all over the ribs. Roast at 400°F for 10 minutes.
5. Reduce the oven temperature to 375°F and continue roasting for another hour, or until the meat is tender enough to almost fall off the bone. Turn once part way through roasting and baste occasionally with the marinade.

## NOTES

I get lazy and don’t turn or baste them and they still turn out just as good._

Goes great with Lemon Roast Potatoes and Horiatiki. Have cut lemons on the table for anyone who wants to add more tang to their ribs
