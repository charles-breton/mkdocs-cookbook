# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Directions  Bake at 400 for about 8-10 minutes (25 minutes pour avoir une croute plus croustillante)**

2. Heat liquid to 110 degrees.  Add yeast and sugar.  Allow to sit for at least 5 minutes to start foaming.
    
3. In a separate bowl, combine all dry ingredients.  Mix thoroughly
    
4. Pour all wet ingredients. Mix by hand for 2 minutes (or use a stand mixer if you own one)
    
5. Dough will be sticky.  Grease hands lightly with oil.  Scoop out and knead with your hands another 5 minutes on parchment paper or cutting board sprinkled with GF all purpose flour.
    
6. Cover dough in the bowl and allow to rise about 25 minutes in a warm place.
    
7. **Preheat oven for at least 25 minutes prior to baking with the baking sheet inside the oven** (measure the parchment paper size before placing in oven)
    
8. Deflate dough.  Divide dough in half.  Grease parchment paper with oil.
    
9. Press dough into desired shape (shape doesn’t matter) making sure to keep dough approximately 1/8 inch thick for a chewy dough like crust. Prick with a fork to help eliminate bubbles.
    
10. Carefully remove the hot baking sheet from the oven and slide under pizza dough and place back into oven.  (The hot pan really helps crisp and set the crust.) 
    
11. Bake for at least 8 minutes on the sheet.  Move the crust directly on to the rack for the last 2 minutes if you want a crispy bottom.  **(25 minutes pour avoir une croute plus croustillante)**
    
12. Repeat with the remaing dough.
    
13. Top with your favorite pizza toppings and bake for an additional 6-8 minutes.

## NOTES

This recipes doubles well.  Since it’s so much work to make pizza dough, I usually make a double batch (4 large pizza crusts) and freeze until I need them.  Just be sure to allow the crusts to cool completely before freezing or else the crust will become soggy from all the ice crystals.  The crust will be cooked but not done completely so a light golden brown means it’s done.
