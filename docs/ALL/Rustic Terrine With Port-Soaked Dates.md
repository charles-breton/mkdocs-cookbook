This coarse-textured terrine makes for a delicious lunch served with grainy mustard, a salad and some good-quality bread. Or slice it thinly for an hors d’oeuvre and place it on top of crackers with a dollop of blackcurrant jelly.

- [ ] ½ tsp (2 mL) sugar
- [ ] 1 tsp (5 mL) salt

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).

2. Over low heat, simmer port and dates in a small saucepan until all the port is absorbed, about 30 minutes. Set dates aside.

3. In a food processor pulse chicken livers, bacon, five-spice powder, cardamom, nutmeg, sugar and salt until the livers are coarsely ground, not fully puréed.
  
4. In a mixer or by hand stir together the liver mixture, sherry, ground pork and pistachios. Combine well. 

5. Line a loaf pan with the prosciutto, first covering the bottom then slightly overlapping slices vertically up the sides of the pan, allowing the ends to hang over the edge. The prosciutto will eventually cover the top of the terrine. 

6. Place one third of the pork mixture in the bottom of the loaf pan. Cover with half of the date mixture; do not spread the mixture all the way to the edges, instead leave a ½-inch (1-cm) space.

7. Cover with another third of the pork, top with the other half of the dates. Cover with the last of the pork. Tap loaf pan to release any air bubbles. 

8. Cover the terrine with the overhanging prosciutto slices and cover the terrine with foil. Place loaf pan in a medium cake pan, pour enough hot water in the cake pan to come halfway up the sides of the loaf pan. Place in preheated oven.

9. Cook for 1½ hours or until a meat thermometer reads an internal temperature of 160°F (70°C). 

10. Let cool, then wrap and refrigerate. Best served the next day, it will last in the refrigerator for 5 days.
