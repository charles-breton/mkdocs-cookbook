# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the Medjool dates in lukewarm water so that they are fully submerged. Soak for 30 minutes.
2. Generously spray a mini-muffin tin. Cut out 12 three-inch strips of parchment paper and line the bottom of each tin so that the parchment paper hangs over the edge. This will allow for easy tart removal. Set aside.
3. In a food processor combine the ingredients for the Walnut Tart Shell. Blend until the pieces are broken down. The dough should stick together when pressed between your fingers. Spoon evenly into 12 mini muffin molds and press down gently to create a thin, even crust on the bottom and sides. Place in the freezer while making the filling.
4. Drain and rinse the dates. Remove the pits and place them in a food processor. Add between 2-4 tablespoons of water and blend until smooth and gooey, scraping down the sides often. Pipe the date filling into the chilled crusts and top with pecans. Place in refrigerator and allow tartlets to set up for at least 1 hour.

## NOTES

**Serving and Storing** - Store the pecan pie in the freezer. When you are ready to serve, let the pecan pie thaw 10 minutes at room temperature before serving. The pie should be served within 20 minutes of thawing. They will soften too much if left out at room temperature. Store leftover in the freezer for up to 2 months.
