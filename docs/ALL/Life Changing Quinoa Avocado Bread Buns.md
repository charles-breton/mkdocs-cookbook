# INSTRUCTIONS

1. ## Preheat the oven to 170C and line a tray with baking paper.Add quinoa to a blender and whiz until you get it to a flour consistency.In a bowl, mix quinoa, almond meal, linseed, sesame seeds, sea salt and baking powder.In a separate bowl, peel and mash the avocado. Add lime zest and juice, honey and water and mix.Add the avocado water mix to the dry ingredients and mix well by hand for 2-3 minutes until you got a sticky, firm dough.Shape 7 balls out of the dough, slightly flatten them (not too much though) and place them in the baking paper, making sure they don’t touch.Bake for around 25 minutes. Check them after about 15 minutes and if the bottom browns more than the top, turn them over for the remaining time. To check if they’re done, poke 2-3 of them with a BBQ skewer and if it comes out clean and if the outside is golden brown, they’re done .Allow them to completely cool before cutting.
2. LATER UPDATE: COOKING WITH QUINOA: TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE *****Baking stage. If you find that after 20-25 minutes your buns are not cooked in the middle, but seem golden on the outside, there two things to look at: maybe you made them a little too big or oven temperature was a little bit higher. Not a problem either way. Cover the buns with al foil so they stop browning on the outside and continue to cook them until done. Please know that these are not soft, spongy breads, like the white bread type of buns. They’re small, dense, nutty and filling. They should not be hard as a rock though – end result is a dense bread, but very easy to bite into, even when toasted.
