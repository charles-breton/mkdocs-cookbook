## PREP

Makes: 3½ to 4 quarts

# INGREDIENTS

2½ lb bony chicken parts (I like to use necks, backs, breastbones, and wings) 

2 to 4 chicken feet (optional) 

2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar 

1 large onion, roughly chopped 

2 carrots, roughly chopped 

3 celery stalks, roughly chopped 

2 leeks (white part only), roughly chopped 

1 garlic bulb, cut in half horizontally 

1 Tbsp black peppercorns, lightly crushed 

2 bay leaves 

2 large handfuls flat-leaf parsley stalks


# INSTRUCTIONS

_Place the chicken parts in a stockpot. Add 5 quarts of cold filtered water and the vinegar. Let stand for 1½ hours to help draw out the nutrients from the bones. 

_Place the pot over medium-high heat, add the vegetables and bring to a boil, skimming off any scum that forms on the surface of the liquiid. Add the peppercorns, garlic, bay leaves. Reduce the heat to low and simmer 12 to 24 hours. The longer you cook the broth, the richer and more flavorful it will be. Just before finishing, add the parsley and simmer for 10 minutes. 

_Strain the broth through a fine sieve into a large storage container, cover, and place in the fridge overnight until the fat rises to the top and congeals. Skim off the fat and reserve for cooking; it will keep in the fridge for up to 1 week or in the freezer for up to 3 months. Transfer the broth to smaller airtight containers. The broth can be stored in the fridge for 3 to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
