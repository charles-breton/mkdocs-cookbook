AUTHOR NOTES

You can make this noodle with chicken breast, very lean pork (look for cuts labeled “tenderloin” or “chop”), or even beef (look for cuts labeled “round,” “chuck,” or “loin”). Noodles made of pork or beef will be even firmer and chewier than chicken. Just make sure that the meat has very little to no fat, and all the silver skins, tendons, and connective tissues are removed.  This dough can be used in place of noodles or pasta in any recipe. Although slightly more work, you can cut them thinner than the “fettucini”-style explained here, or even mold them into your favorite short pasta shapes like cavatelli or orecchiette. If you want to make these in advance, I don't recommend freezing longer noodles, but you can certainly freeze shorter shapes (freeze them solid in a single layer on a lined sheet pan first, then transfer to a container). Read the instructions carefully for technique. If you like a super-chewy noodle, you can use 1 1/2 cup of tapioca starch and no cornstarch. If you want them to be softer, you can increase the ratio of cornstarch to 1 cup (and use 1/2 cup tapioca).   Because of the texture of this dough, it will not do well in an electric or hand-cranked pasta roller. But don't worry—it's easy to do by hand. —Mandy @ Lady and pup

# INSTRUCTIONS

#### **Noodles**

1. Dice the chicken breast (or pork or beef) into bite-sized pieces, and place in a food processor with salt. Run the processor for 1-2 minutes, until the meat is pureed into a completely smooth pink goo-like substance. If you're using pork or beef, you may need to process them a minute longer because of their tougher, longer fibers.
2. In a medium bowl, pour the boiling water into the tapioca flour. Use a spoon to combine until a dry and shaggy mixture forms. Add the mixture into the food-processor, along with 1/3 cup cornstarch, and pulse until a dough-like mixture forms. The dough should be slightly sticky, leaving just a little bit on your fingers when you tap on it. If it's stickier than that, add the rest of the cornstarch and pulse again, until smooth, bouncy, and just a bit sticky.
3. Transfer the dough onto a work surface dusted with more tapioca flour to prevent sticking. Dust the dough with flour. Gently knead the dough together just a couple times to ensure it’s smooth and even. Gently pat the dough into a rectangle, dust the log with a bit more flour, then roll it out into a rectangular sheet about 1/16-inch (1.5 mm) thick. (For short pasta shapes, pat the dough into a thick log before shaping.) It's important that you keep both sides of the dough well-floured with flour as you go: Scatter more flour onto the surface of the dough and smooth with your hands throughout the rolling process. Because of the nature of gluten-free dough, it will break more easily than wheat doughs, so don't be alarmed if there is some breakage on the edges. If the dough cracks in the center, simply pinch it back together.
4. Keeping both sides of the dough well-floured, fold the sheet in half lengthwise (from north to south), until the dough is about the length of your knife. (If your knife is shorter, fold the dough in half again lengthwise.) Gently transfer the folded dough onto a cutting board. Trim the irregular edges of the dough and discard. With a sharp knife, slice the dough 1/2-inch (1 cm) noodles. (Because of their fibrous texture, cut in a single south-to-north slicing motion.)
5. Unfold the noodles gently and return them to the floured work surface. Don’t fluff or curl them up like you'd do with normal noodles, as this dough breaks easily.

#### **Alfredo Sauce**

1. Bring a large pot of water with a hefty pinch of salt to boil for the pasta. Meanwhile, heat a small pot or skillet over medium high heat and melt butter with olive oil until you start to hear a sizzle. Add garlic, thyme, and ground black pepper, and cook for a few seconds, until fragrant. Remove from heat.
2. In a medium to large pot, combine heavy cream, milk, yogurt, fish sauce, nutmeg, and a hefty pinch of grated Parmigiano, and bring mixture to a simmer over medium heat, just until the cheese melts and warmed through. Stir to combine, then turn off the heat and set aside.
3. When the water comes to a rapid boil, gently transfer the noodles into the pot. Gently stir with a wooden spoon to prevent sticking, and cook for about 30 seconds more after the noodles float to the surface.
4. Remove the noodles with a strainer and transfer directly into the pot with the cream mixture. Return the pot to medium-high heat and cook until the cream returns to a simmer and has thickened slightly.
5. Plate the pasta, then drizzle the butter mixture over the top of each serving. Serve immediately with more grated Parmigiano.
