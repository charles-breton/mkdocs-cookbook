# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Now the principles involved as the name might tell you are that you need an equal quantity of each of the ingredient. That is all you need to remember. If you take 455g or 1ld of flour, 455g or 1ld sugar, 455g or 1lb fat and 500g or 1lb of egg and you will end up with a good cake at the end of it. All you have to remember is to sieve the flour to get rid of any lumps that might be in it and to have beaten the eggs as well. How you mix it is up to you.
2. First it depends on the fat you are using. If you are using margarine then start by mixing the sugar and the margarine together so that this cream together. That is so you want all the sugar and fat to blend so it starts to change colure and go a little lighter. Then add your beaten eggs to the mix and finally the flour that you will have sieved. Once you have a nice smooth batter them put this into a cake tin and bake till it is cooked out and you will have a sponge cake to be proud of.
3. If you are using butter then you might want to do it this way. Heat the butter up gently till it all melts. Add the sugar to the eggs first. Whisk this up then add the sieved flour. Mix this till you have a good looking batter then add the melted butter a bit at a time. Not too much at once or to hot as it will split the eggs. This way seems to make a slightly richer finish to the sponge.
4. Once you have master these two simple cake making process then look at what you want it to be when you make it. If you want it to be a chocolate cake then take out some of the flour and add some coco powder and that will give you a chocolate sponge. The amount that you add is up to you I would use no more than 100g or 2 ounces. Just ad the coco powder to the flour when you sieve it and let it all blend together. Then proceed as normal.
5. If you want to make a steam sponge just steam the mix it will work just as well as if you bake it. That is the beauty of this mix it is a very easy thing to do and hard to mess up.
