# INGREDIENTS

#### BOTTOM
 
- [ ] Any cookies (dry type) you like, I use Petit Beurre – you can use Lady Fingers or similar – the filling will make them soft.  
- [ ] Coconut Filling:
- [ ] 250 g mascarpone cheese
- [ ] 1 and ½ cup icing sugar ( I use half of this or a bit more if I use alcohol) 
- [ ] 250 bakers cheese or Greek yogurt – do not use Philadelphia – it is too salty – I buy baker’s cheese in Polish store it is like cream cheese but with no salt in it)
- [ ] 2 cans of coconut milk 2 x 400 ml
- [ ] 200 g white chocolate 
- [ ] Malibu  or other coconut alcohol – I always use – once I did not and it was not that tasty
- [ ] 2 and ½ gelatine 

#### Decoration:

- [ ] Coconut shaving about 50g, almond shaving, I used whipping cream and on top fresh berries -or whatever your imagination gives you

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Fill the form (25 cm in diameter) with the cookies. Set aside.
2. Using a mixer, mix  the mascarpone cheese and icing sugar until smooth and fluffy, about 5 minutes.
3. Gradually add the cheese (or yogourt) and the coconut milk, mixing all the time.
4. Melt the white chocolate in a steam bath and then add to the cheese mixture.
5. Add alcohol if you choose to add it – I usually add Malibu as much as I feel like it – plus sometimes I add orange oil or vanilla 
6. Soak the gelatine in water and then melt in a steam bath, once melted and smooth, cool it a bit. Add a couple of spoons of the filling to the gelatine and mix well. Sometimes gelatine crumbles so you need to do it this way – once smooth pour back into the filling.
7. Transfer the filling on the cookies – delicately so that the cookies don’t swim in the filling.
8. Keep in the refrigerator for a couple of hours, or even better, overnight.
