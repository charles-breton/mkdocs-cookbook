# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line a 6 inch tin with non-stick baking paper and set aside.
    
2. In a food processor, process Rolled Oats till you have oat flour. It doesn't have to be perfectly ground but you don't want huge chunks of oats left in.
    
3. Add in salt, vanilla, and dates. Process until you have a clumpy mixture and the dates have been chopped up and evenly distributed with the oats. Add water in and process until the mixture resembles cookie dough.
    
4. Press mixture onto the bottom of your lined tin and place in the freezer.
    
5. In the same food processor, combine all the ingredients for your Banana Date Caramel. Process till smooth and then spread on your chilled biscuit base in an even layer, using a spatula to flatten any peaks or irregularities.
    
6. Place tin in the freezer for at least 4 hours. The Banana Date Caramel will never freeze solid, but don't worry.
    
7. After freezing, turn your Twix slab onto a cutting board and cut into 12 even squares with a sharp knife. Place squares on a non-stick parchment lined baking tray and return to the freezer.
    
8. Whilst bars are in the freezer, melt your raw dark chocolate, making sure to not exceed 118 degrees Fahrenheit. Alternatively, prepare the chocolate coating recipe in the link above.
    
9. When you are ready, remove bars from the freezer and individually dip them into your chocolate. Shake excess chocolate off and place back onto lined baking tray. Just before the chocolate sets, use a fork to create prong marks on top (purely visual). You don't have to if you don't want to.
    
10. Repeat the process with your remaining bars and store bars in the freezer. Enjoy!
