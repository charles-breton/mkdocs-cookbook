# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut sweet potatoes into cubes.

2. Add your cubed sweet potatoes into a pot with boiling salted water and cook until tender.

3. Once cooked, make sure to remove excess moisture from the potato so it will crisp later on.

4. Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons of coconut oil in a pan and add the finely chopped red onions, garlic and bell peppers. Season these veggies with salt, pepper and garlic powder.

5. Sauté this mixture until golden brown, which will take approximately five to seven minutes.

6. Once these are ready, remove them and place aside.

7. In the same pan, add the rest of the olive oil, and add your drained and dried sweet potatoes to the pan. Season it with salt, pepper and paprika.

8. Cook until potatoes have a golden brown crust on all sides. This will take another five to eight minutes.

9. Once that is achieved, add the onion and pepper mixture with the potato in the pan and sauté together for another minute or two.

10. Garnish with the cilantro.

### *EXTRA* :

When people think of lobster, they usually associate it with extravagance. According to Business Insider, restaurants typically charge $30 to $45 for a single lobster.1 These prices can turn many people away from lobster, which is delicious and contains astaxanthin,2 a carotenoid with various health benefits.3

The expensive prices are attributed to the simple fact the crustaceans are harvested from the wild because there are no commercial lobster farms. Fishermen have to wait for lobsters to mature, which takes about seven years before they are legal harvesting size.4 In addition, once gathered, lobsters must be kept alive and fresh — thus adding to shipping costs — because they are susceptible to bacterial disease, which can spoil the meat quickly if the lobster dies.5

## How to Prepare Lobster Tail

If you’ve decided to purchase lobster to cook at home, the tail is a good place to start. The process starts with choosing the best meat first. According to BBC Food, there are two main species of lobster used for cooking: the American (or Maine) or European lobster. Maine lobster is considered the largest and the best, while the European lobster is smaller. However, both can be used in recipes depending on what you can find.6  
Buying lobster tails requires discerning eyes so you can get the most out of your money — after all, lobster is an expensive food. When looking for lobster tails, first make sure they come from reputable harvesters, then follow these additional tips:7

- Cold water lobster tails are commonly sold in grocery stores and restaurants in North America. They are generally more expensive because of the higher-quality meat compared to warm water lobster tails.
- An alternative to American lobster tails are warm water lobster tails, usually from the spiny Caribbean or rock species.
- To manage your budget, keep an eye on the weight of the lobster tail. The heavier the package, the more expensive it becomes.
- Avoid lobster tails that look yellow or gray. Avoid meats with glazing as well (a process where water is injected to the tail to increase shelf life during shipping).

Once you’ve purchased lobster tails you’re satisfied with, here’s how to prepare the meat to get the most out of your purchase, according to Better Homes & Gardens:8

1. In one hand, hold the lobster tail. With the other hand, cut lengthwise through the center of the shell and the meat using kitchen shears. Stop cutting as you reach the end of the shell, which is the wide end of the tail.
2. Spread the cut further apart, then loosen the meat with your fingers.
3. Separate the meat using your thumbs, but keep some of it attached near the end of the tail.

## How Long Does It Take to Cook Fresh Lobster Tail?

The cooking time for fresh lobster tail depends on the recipe, the size of the lobster tail and your chosen cooking method. Working Mother offers the following approximates for cooking lobster tails:9

- **Boiling —** Lobster tails are generally boiled for three minutes and 30 seconds to four minutes.
- **Steaming —** Lobster tails usually cook for eight to 10 minutes when steamed.
- **Broiling —** It usually takes 10 to 15 minutes to broil lobster tails.
- **Grilling —** Grill the lobster tail flesh side down for two to three minutes, then flip with the shell side down and cook for another six to eight minutes, transferring it to a cooler part of the grill.

## How Long Does It Take to Cook Frozen Lobster Tail?

Better Homes & Gardens recommends placing your lobster tail in the refrigerator overnight for eight to 10 hours.10 If you’re in a hurry or forgot to thaw your lobster tails overnight, Working Mother indicates that you can quickly thaw your tails in a bowl of water and defrost them in an hour or so.11

Ideally, lobster tails should be thawed because it results in more tender meat once cooked. However, you can still cook your lobster tails frozen, although you will need to add a few minutes to your cooking time. Larger tails may need double the cooking time, if cooked frozen.12
