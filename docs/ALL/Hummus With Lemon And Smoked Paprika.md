# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] _Chick peas (2 cups dry that you soak in water overnight**(ajouter 1/2 to 1 tsp baking soda to the water (it will help to skin the chickpeas), drain and then cook in a pressure cooker for 25 minutes or 2 cans of unsalted chick peas of 540 ml)
- [ ] Add 3-4 ice cubes, and water only if needed afterwards 
- [ ] _3/4 to 1 cup of raw tahini
- [ ] [TRY Roasted Garlic]  _2-3 garlic clove, peeled (crush it with a knife and let if stand 10 minutes before using for any recipe to get the most health benefits from garlic) [https://www.alphafoodie.com/how-to-roast-garlic-in-the-oven/#recipe](https://www.alphafoodie.com/how-to-roast-garlic-in-the-oven/#recipe)

	- [Preheat the oven to 400ºF/200ºC.]
		
	- [When roasting individual cloves, place the unpeeled cloves in a tin foil (or parchment paper) packet, drizzled with a bit of olive oil, then roast until tender. Checking at the 15-minute mark, returning to the oven if needed, and checking every few minutes until ready.] 
- [ ] _2 tbsp (about) of onion or 1 shallot, peeled and quartered, or 3 greens onions (I usually use white onions)
- [ ] _1 celery stick
- [ ] _Juice of 3 lemons and zest of 1 lemon 
- [ ] _2 tsp salt (use Himalayan salt ideally or sea salt but never use table salt)
- [ ] _1 (hefty) tbsp of nutritional yeast
- [ ] _3 tbsp of apple cider vinegar
- [ ] _2 tsp smoked paprika
- [ ] _1/8 tsp of cayenne pepper
- [ ] _2 tsp turmeric powder
- [ ] _water for desired consistency (usually I use 3 1/2 tbsp) Wait until the end before putting it to make sure it is not too liquid because some lemons are more juicy than others

#### To put on top:

- [ ] Olive oil
- [ ] Smoked paprika

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **[[FORGOT TO SOAK YOUR BEANS? HERE’S A QUICK SOAK METHOD](https://keviniscooking.com/forgot-soak-beans-heres-quick-soak-method/)

		- Rinse your beans in a colander with cool water. Pick through and discard any little stones that may be packaged with them accidentally.
		    
		- Cover the beans in a pot with about 2 inches of water.
		    
		- On high heat, bring the water to a boil and cook the beans for 5 minutes without a lid.
		    
		- Remove the pot from the heat and cover with a lid. Let the beans soak in the hot water for an hour.
		    
		- Drain the beans into a colander, rinse and then cook according to your favorite recipe.]

2. Combine all ingredients in a blender. Blend until smooth. Add more lemon if desired. Transfer in a serving bowl. Dig a circular trench in the hummus, 1/2 in from the edge of the bowl. Drizzle oil in trench and sprinkle smoked paprika on top.

3. "If using dry chickpeas: You can soak overnight if you prefer or soak the beans for a couple of days until they begin to sprout.
4. Make sure you change the water they are soaking in twice daily to keep bacteria at bay. Drain the water and rinse the beans before cooking.
5. When you are ready to cook your soaked beans, place them in a large pot and cover with several inches of water
6. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Add salt, if desired-- I use about 1/4 teaspoon of salt per 2 quarts of water/2 cups of soaked beans.
7. Let the beans cook for 60-90 minutes till desired tenderness. Certain dishes require very tender beans (like hummus), while other dishes call for firmer beans (like stews and soups that need to be cooked over long periods of time). Adjust cooking time to achieve the desired tenderness for your purposes. If you are freezing the beans, keep in mind that they will freeze best if they are on the firmer side, rather than completely soft. As you cook them, the beans will continue to expand a bit. Keep an eye on the water level and add additional water as needed to keep the beans covered.
