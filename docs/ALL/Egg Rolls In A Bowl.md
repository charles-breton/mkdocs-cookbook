## NOTES




## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- **Ground pork** - This keto egg roll in a bowl recipe is made with ground pork, but it is also excellent with ground beef, ground sausage, ground turkey, or a combination of any of ground meats.
- **Soy sauce -** If you don't eat soy, coconut aminos is a great substitute for this pork egg roll in a bowl.
- **Sriracha -** This adds the perfect amount of heat. While sriracha really adds something special to this dish, it is still fantastic without it.
- **Rice vinegar -** make sure to use unseasoned rice vinegar to keep keto-friendly and sugar free. Seasoned rice vinegar has sugar added.
- **Toasted sesame oil -** this imparts a slight nuttiness to the flavor of the dish.
- **Ground ginger:** You can also use a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger.

## TIPS

- **Storage:** Store leftover low carb egg roll in a bowl in the fridge for up to 5 days. ([These are my favorite storage and meal prep containers](https://amzn.to/3vbp9hk))
- **Reheating:** I recommend reheating this in the microwave, or in a pan on the stove top.
- **Use broccoli slaw:** This keto egg roll in a bowl is also delicious with broccoli slaw in place of the coleslaw.
- Add noodles: Serve it with these [Sesame Ginger Noodles](https://peaceloveandlowcarb.com/sesame-ginger-noodles/), or just cook up some [shirataki noodles](https://amzn.to/3JTIqbt) in soy sauce, rice vinegar and sriracha.
- **Serve it on rice:** If you are not concerned with the carb count, this is delicious served on top of white rice. For a low carb rice option, serve it on top of this [Cilantro Lime Cauliflower Rice](https://hungryfoodie.com/cilantro-lime-cauliflower-rice/).
