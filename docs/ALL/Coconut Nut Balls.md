# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all three nuts in a food processor and pulse a few times until they are finely chopped.
2. Add remaining ingredients (except additional 1/4 cup coconut flakes for rolling) to the food processor and process until the mixture comes together and starts to stick. This will only take about 1 minute.
3. Transfer mixture to a small bowl.
4. Pour remaining coconut flakes into a dish.
5. Roll nut mixture into balls using your hands then place in the dish and roll in coconut flakes.
6. You can eat them as is or transfer to a parchment lined baking sheet and refrigerate to firm them up a bit.
7. Once refrigerated for about an hour, they can be wrapped up individually for easy snacking.

## NOTES

If you don't have coconut butter, use additional coconut flakes and a bit more honey. It just acts as another binding and sweetening agent.
