When the word “pudding” comes to mind, most people think of a very sweet and creamy food item. Pudding is usually made with a sweet milk base to produce a dish with a similar consistency to egg-based custards or mousse.1 However, if you’re tired of that typical heavy texture, you can use seeds to make a light but delicious pudding.

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1/3 cup chia seeds
- [ ] 1 cup organic coconut milk
- [ ] 2 Tbsp. Dr. Mercola’s raw honey

- [ ] 1/4 tsp. cinnamon

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all ingredients and mix well. Refrigerate for five to 30 minutes so the chia seeds absorb the moisture and becomes a pudding.
2. If pudding is too thick, you can add more milk to thin it out to your desired consistency.
3. Add your favorite topping such as strawberries, blueberries, blackberries or slices of banana and enjoy!
