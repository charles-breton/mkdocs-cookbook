The frittata is similar to the classic omelet, containing scrambled eggs with a filling like cheese or vegetables. It is easy to prepare and highly customizable as well. It is fried on a pan first, and then transferred into an oven to be baked.

This wonderful frittata recipe is from Marisa Moon, owner of [My Longevity Kitchen](http://mylongevitykitchen.com/). It uses healthy ingredients that contain vitamins and minerals that are essential for optimal health.

However, I advise consuming potato frittatas in moderation. Scrambling the eggs can contribute to chronic inflammation because the cholesterol found in the yolks oxidizes during cooking when it mixes with the iron in the whites. [Potatoes](https://foodfacts.mercola.com/potato.html) are also high in starch, which may raise your blood sugar levels if they're eaten regularly.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Wash the outside of the leeks, and then cut off the ends where the green starts getting darker. Save the greens to make stock (leeks and water make a decent veggie stock). Slice the leeks in half lengthwise, while keeping the roots intact. Wash the leeks by rinsing between the layers, but still keeping each half intact. Finally, slice the leeks into half-moon shapes.
3. Wash the potatoes then slice them in half lengthwise, and then slice each half lengthwise again. Now slice the potatoes into 1/4 inches or little triangles.
4. Using a non-stick 12-inch skillet (or the largest skillet you have), heat the 3 Tbsp. of butter over medium heat.
5. Once the butter is melted, add the leeks then cook them for two minutes while stirring occasionally.
6. Add the potatoes, then cook them for two minutes while stirring sporadically. If your butter is unsalted, add 1/2 tsp. of fine sea salt to the potatoes.
7. Add 1 Tbsp. of water to the pan then turn the heat to low. Cover the pan with a lid and let the veggies steam for three minutes.
8. Meanwhile, whisk together the 8 eggs along with 1/2 tsp. each of fine sea salt and pepper.
9. Remove the lid and stir the veggies. Let it cook for one minute longer uncovered so the water evaporates. Taste a potato to be sure it’s soft, and check if it needs more salt.
10. Slowly pour the whisked eggs over the entire pan, and spread the veggies around to encourage the eggs to reach all the crevices.
11. Now, place dill sprigs along the top of the egg, then tuck them under so the egg coats the dill. Turn off the heat afterwards.
12. Transfer the frittata to the oven, and set a timer for 10 minutes if you used a 12-inch pan (12 to 15 minutes for a smaller pan).
13. Mix together your dipping sauce ingredients using a whisk or fork.
14. Slice the frittata into triangles once it has cooled. You can enjoy it at room temperature or even cold. Use the sauce as a dip, or spread the sauce on top of the frittata.

### *EXTRA* :


## Pasture-Raised Eggs Are the Foundation of This Dish

[Pasture-raised eggs](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/egg-nutrition-facts.htm) come from chickens that forage their natural diet of worms and insects in a wide, open farm, and are raised without antibiotics and pesticides. As a result, the eggs are superior to commercially harvested eggs because they are healthier and safer.

A study released by Mother Earth News highlights the advantages of pasture-raised eggs over commercially raised eggs. Compared to commercially raised eggs, the study found that pasture-raised eggs have:1

- One-third less cholesterol
- One-fourth less saturated fat
- Two thirds more vitamin A
- Twice the amount of [omega-3](https://articles.mercola.com/omega-3.aspx) fatty acids
- Three times more vitamin E
- Seven times more beta-carotene

Again, please note that scrambled eggs should be seldomly eaten. The cholesterol in the yolk becomes oxidized when it mixes with the iron in the whites during cooking, which can lead to chronic inflammation.

## Yukon Gold Potatoes: The 'Meat' of the Frittata

Yukon Gold potatoes were created by Garnet Richard Johnston, who was a highly-regarded Canadian potato grower.2 The potatoes are known for their signature golden hue and rich, buttery flavor when cooked.3 As for the nutrients, potatoes are known to contain:

- **Both soluble and insoluble fibers**
- **Vitamins:** Vitamin B6, thiamin, niacin, [pantothenic acid](https://articles.mercola.com/vitamins-supplements/pantothenic-acid.aspx) and folate
- **Minerals:** manganese, phosphorus, copper, potassium, magnesium and iron
- [**Antioxidants**](https://articles.mercola.com/antioxidants.aspx)**:** flavonoids, carotenoids and caffeic acid

In a study released by the Institute of Food Research (IFR), potatoes are found to have kukoamines, a compound that can aid in lowering blood pressure. The fiber in potatoes can also help prevent constipation and support the digestion and absorption of simple sugars.

However, I advise caution when consuming potatoes because of their high starch content. Too much starch can raise your blood sugar levels, which can be detrimental to your health in the long run.

## Leeks and Sprigs Add Flavor and Aroma to This Frittata Recipe

Leeks are alliums that taste similar to onions, but are milder and sweeter, making them perfect for this recipe as their flavor will not overpower the other ingredients. They are good sources of vitamin K and A, and contain a flavonoid called kaempferol, a powerful compound that can help protect blood vessels from damage. Leeks also have allicin, which produces sulfenic acid, a compound that helps fight free radicals.

Dill sprigs, on the other hand, provide a tangy aroma and flavor to the recipe. They are highly regarded for their abundance of monoterpenes that activate the enzyme glutathione-S-transferase, a powerful antioxidant.4

## Make Your Own Mayonnaise Instead

Commercially manufactured mayonnaise typically contains genetically enhanced (GE) soybean oil, which is harmful to your health. I recommend making your own mayonnaise instead. You can follow this [homemade recipe](https://recipes.mercola.com/homemade-condiment-recipes.aspx) to make your own version packed with flavor and nutrients.

As for organic mustard, it's known for phytonutrients that can help fight gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer. It is also a good source of selenium, which can help manage asthma and [rheumatoid arthritis](https://articles.mercola.com/rheumatoid-arthritis.aspx).5
