# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cover a frying pan with oil/butter and allow to heat up on low.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the eggs/egg whites and whisk until opaque. Sift in the coconut flour and whisk very well until clumps are removed. Add in the spices of choice and sea salt and whisk once more.
3. Once frying pan is hot, pour the "pizza" mixture in the pan and ensure it is fully coated. Cover the pan with a lid/tray for 3-4 minutes or until bubbles start to appear on top. Flip, cook for an extra 2 minutes and remove from pan.
4. Allow to cool slightly before topping and using as a pizza base or even eating on it's own.

## NOTES

The side which was facedown for the shorter amount of time is best to be used for topping.These work well in batch cooking- It's best made in groupings of 4 and using 1/2 cup of coconut flour sifted.For a thin and crispier base, go the full egg whites.For a firmer, thicker base, go for the first version.
