3. Remove from the microwave, and stir.
4. Return the bowl to the microwave and repeat, stopping to stir every 15 seconds until the mixture is completely melted.
5. Add the remaining ingredients, and stir until they are well-combined.

## NOTES

## TIPS

- Make sure the bowl does not have any water or moisture in it when you melt the chocolate, as it'll cause it to seize up. 
- Loosely cover the chocolate in the fridge as it sets up, so it doesn't absorb any scents from the fridge. 
- Feel free to change around the nuts for a different flavour.
- **To store:** Place the chocolate coconut bars in the fridge in an airtight container.
- **To freeze:** Freeze in a freezer-safe bag or container for up to 3 months.
