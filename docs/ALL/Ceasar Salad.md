# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Rinse the lettuce very well under running water, one leaf at a time. Make sure there is no soil or sand in the buttom part near the roots. Sand in your salad is not tasty! Once clean, spin the romaine leaves dry in a salad spinner and put into a large bowl. Tear or cut leaves into bite-size pieces.
2. Grind the pumpkin seeds. I like to use a kitchen utensil called a Salad Shooter , or you can use a grinder.
3. Add the ground seeds to the lettuce and toss well. (The pumpkin seeds are a substitute for the Parmesan cheese used in convential Caesar salad recipes.)
4. In a small bowl, blend 1 or 2 pressed cloves of garlic, lemon juice, Dijon mustard, olive oil, a sprinkle of white pepper and Celtic sea salt. Pour over the lettuce and toss well.
