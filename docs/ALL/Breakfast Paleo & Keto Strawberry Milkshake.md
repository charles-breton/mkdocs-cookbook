# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **One of the great things about this milkshake is that you can customize it to your taste buds' desires! Want more thickness and fiber? Add more chia seeds! Keeping carbs to a minimum? Keep the strawberries and coconut milk in check! And feel free to add-in your collagen and MCT oil.**
      
2. **Add coconut milk, chia seeds, strawberries, vanilla extract, salt, sweetener and add-ins of choice to a blender (bullets work best here!). Blend until creamy smooth, using a little water as needed.**  
    
3. **Add in ice and blend until thick and creamy. Do not over-blend, or you'll lose coldness. Enjoy right away!**
