# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and position the rack to the middle. Spray a small rimmed sheet pan (jelly roll pan) with baking spray and then line the bottom with parchment paper. The baking spray keeps the parchment in place. My quarter sheet pan measures 12 x 8 1/2 inches at the base of the pan and 13 x 9 1/2 inches at the top (around the rim).
2. Measure the dry ingredients for the cake into a medium bowl and stir to mix thoroughly. Then, add the eggs, coconut milk, lemon juice, vanilla and stevia glycerite to the bowl and mix with a hand mixture until ingredients are incorporated.
3. Pour the batter into the parchment lined baking sheet and gently spread it to the edges of the pan. Place the cake into the oven and turn it up to 400 for 5 minutes. Then turn it back down to 350 for about 20 minutes more until fully cooked and lightly browned on top.
4. Remove the shortcake from the oven and let cool completely before cutting. Cut into 12 squares or use a biscuit cutter to cut into circles.
5. Dice strawberries and mix with two tbsp of sweetener to mascerate. Whip the cream with the vanilla and 2 tbsp of sweetener until very thick. (I often add a pinch of xanthan gum to stabilize the whipped cream)
6. To plate, add a dollop of whipped cream to a piece of cake and top with the freshly sliced berries. Piping the whipped cream is also a nice effect. Serves 12.
