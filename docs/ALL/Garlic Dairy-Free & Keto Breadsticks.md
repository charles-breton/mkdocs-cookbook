# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C. Line a baking tray with a baking mat or parchment paper.
2. Whip up a batch of our Crazy Keto Dough. Allow dough to rest for 10 minutes while you prep the rest (and up to 5 days in the fridge).
3. Make compound garlic butter by mixing the softened butter with the parsley, garlic, and garlic powder. Set aside. 
4. Roll out the rested dough between two sheets of parchment paper with a rolling pin until roughly 10x10 inches in size. To get a perfect square, simply trim the uneven edges, patch them up and keep rolling until evenly sized. 
5. Assemble by brushing with compound butter, folding the dough in half and cutting into 10 strips with a pastry cutter. Twist the strips, pinching the dough together to seal closed. You can freeze the breadsticks at this point for two months, and bake straight from the freezer (adding a few more minutes in the oven). 
6. Place the breadsticks in prepared tray and bake for 15 minutes for doughy sticks and 20-25 for crispier ones (what I did!). Brush with a touch more melted butter and sprinkle with fresh parsley.
7. These guys are best served warm straight from the oven, but they also do re-warm quite well. Keep in the fridge for 3 days and freeze for 2 months.

## NOTES

*I like to **add both fresh and powdered garlic** for a double kick, but feel free to use just one or the other too. 

Please note that nutrition facts below are estimated for the keto breadstick.
