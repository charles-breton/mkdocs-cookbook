## NOTES

If you’re new to lamb, this delicious marinade gives it a nice flavor that isn’t lamb-y. The fresh herbs and the vinegar both counter the charring of the meat that tends to be carcinogenic.

Lamb is rich in iron, specifically ‘heme’ iron which is more absorbable than non-heme iron sources in vegetables.

This easy recipe is great for BBQ season. Pair with a Greek salad, some sautéed vegetables, a chunk of hot sweet potato. It’s an easy, tasty, gourmet dinner!



## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

1 lb grass-fed lamb cubes 

2 cloves fresh garlic, finely chopped

 2 twigs fresh rosemary, stems removed

Handful of fresh mint leaves (10-12 leaves)

1 tablespoon cold-pressed olive oil 

1/3 cup balsamic vinegar 

Sea salt- a few pinches

 Pepper- a few good shakes 

Skewer sticks (4-6)


# INSTRUCTIONS

Put lamb cubes in a bowl, add in all other ingredients, stir well. Refrigerate the bowl.

Stir again. Skewer cubes onto sticks, leaving space between each cube. Optionally you can also skewer chunks of onion, red pepper, cherry tomato or similar. Grill on BBQ until well cooked (just a tad pink and soft in middle), turning as needed.
