What if we told you there’s a way to make grain-free pizza that’s healthy, simple and doesn’t require you to turn on the oven? The secret: [Chickpea flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GUGUET0/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=cleaplat-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00GUGUET0&linkId=f23fb3d24be4a43ed98b3e09dac0aef4).

Along with pizza crust, this amazing protein- and fiber-rich flour makes delicious cookies and veggie burgers. It has a slightly nutty flavor, but it’s nut free, so it’s a versatile, crowd-pleasing grain-free alternative that’s fantastic to have in your back pocket.

Back to the pizza. Instead of baking, you make this crust, called socca, in a skillet. This Italian chickpea-flour flatbread is traditionally served without toppings, but we’re going to show you three different options so you can whip up an easy, healthy, oven-free dinner that feels like an indulgence.

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 ¼ cups water
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for the pan
- [ ] ½ teaspoon salt
- [ ] ¼ teaspoon garlic powder (optional)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a bowl, combine chickpea flour, water, 1 tablespoon olive oil, salt, and garlic powder, if desired, and whisk together until smooth. (You can do this in a blender or with an immersion blender, if you prefer.)
    
2. Place a medium skillet over medium heat until hot. Test the heat by flicking a few drops of water on it; it's ready when it sizzles right away. Add enough olive oil to cover the base of the pan with a thin layer; heat for up to 30 seconds (do not let it smoke). Pour in ⅓ to ½ cup batter; swirl it around so it covers the whole base. Cook for about 3 minutes, until bubbles form all over the surface. Flip it and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer.
    
3. Remove from pan with a spatula, transfer to a plate and add toppings right away. Repeat with more oil and remaining batter. (You can also make the soccas up to 1 day ahead; reheat for 2 minutes in the same pan, turning once.)
