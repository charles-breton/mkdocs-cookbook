# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat the oil in a slightly heavy-bottomed pan. (In India, we use something called a kadhai, shaped similar to a wok.) Add the mustard, cumin seeds, and curry leaves. (Careful as they will sputter.) Saute for half a minute.
2. Add the chopped onions and saute over medium heat till they are translucent.
3. Add the cauliflower, potatoes, turmeric, chilli, and coriander powder and mix well. Cover and cook over low heat so that the vegetables cook in their own steam. Stir from time to time.
4. After about ten minutes, add garam masala powder, salt, and pepper and mix well. Cover and cook till the vegetables are completely tender, another 10 to 15 mins. (Check as this sometimes varies depending on the type of potatoes.)
5. Serve hot garnished with the coriander leaves.

## NOTES

For a very long time, this was the only way mom could make me eat any cauliflower (I hated it in everything else). It's a simple Indian recipe (aloo—potatoes, gobhi—cauliflower), part of a homely, everyday meal. It is in fact so humble that we take it for granted—when I called mom up to confirm the recipe, she asked me: "Are you sure this is the recipe you want? I have a new biryani recipe..." You can find all the ingredients easily at any Indian store. Like many Indian dishes, you can make it ahead of time—serve hot with chapatis. —[Heena](https://food52.com/users/11679-heena)

###### TEST KITCHEN NOTES

Heena's aloo gobhi is warming and delicious. The cauliflower and potato all steam together nicely, as the well-balanced cocktail of spices seep in. The perfect finishing touch would be a dollop of yogurt or raita. - Kristen —The Editors
