## NOTES




## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

Makes 1 taco-seasoning packet worth.

- 1 Tbsp. Chili Powder
    
- 1/4 tsp. Garlic Powder
    
- 1/4 tsp. Onion Powder
    
- 1/4 tsp. Crushed Red Pepper Flakes
    
- 1/4 tsp. Dried Oregano
    
- 1/2 tsp. Paprika
    
- 1 1/2 tsp. Ground Cumin (essai avec 1 tsp)
    
- 1 tsp. Sea Salt
    
- 1 tsp. Black Pepper (optional)

# INSTRUCTIONS

Now for the easy part: mix all the spices together and store in an airtight container. The optional black pepper is to increase the spiciness based on your family’s tastes and preferences. If you don’t like spicy foods, simply leave the black pepper out and/or be sure to adjust that tablespoon of chili powder down.

The amounts listed above make up about 2 Tbsp. of homemade taco seasoning mix — the perfect amount to replace one store bought 1.25oz packet.
