# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add chickpeas and minced garlic to the bowl of a food processor. Puree until a smooth, powder-like mixture forms.
    
2. While processor is running, add ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth consistency.
    
3. [No]: Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of [Early Harvest EVOO](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/early-harvest-extra-virgin-olive-oil/). Add a few chickpeas to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle [sumac](https://shop.themediterraneandish.com/product/sumac/)on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies.

## NOTES

1. If starting with dry chickpeas, allow extra time for soaking (overnight) and cooking (2 hours).
    
2. **To cook dry chickpeas:**soak chickpeas in plenty of water overnight (water needs to be at least doubled the volume of chickpeas). When ready, drain chickpeas and place them in a medium-sized heavy cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 ½ to 2 hours. [25 minutes au Presto]
    
3. **If using canned chickpeas**, make sure they are drained and rinsed. It helps if you also give them a quick 20-minute simmer in a bit of water so they soften well (dry them before use).
    
4. **To peel chickpeas (cooked or from a can):**cover cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 ½ teaspoon baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. Take a handful of chickpeas and rub under running water to remove the skins. Place peeled chickpeas in a bowl.
    
5. **Need to thicken your hummus some more?** If for some reason, you ended up using a bit more liquid that you should have, cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or so before using. It should thicken up a bit. Otherwise, another trick I used to do is to add 1 to 2 tablespoon of Greek yogurt to hummus to also add some creaminess (you would  have to blend it again in the food processor). But with this recipe (and tips mentioned above) I have not needed to do this.
