# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a bowl, I mixed the following together: all ingredients
2. *you can add fresh herbs too–it’s really good! I often add several dashes of pizza seasoning–it tastes amazing and is really easy! (updated)
3. **I generally use half and half or heavy cream as the liquid—the bread is fluffiest this way! I also leave out the baking soda and baking powder when I use these liquids (updated)
4. Stir until there are no lumps. Let it sit for a minute (the batter will get a little fluffier). Melt a tablespoon or two of butter (Ideally, pastured, organic, local!) in the pan, and pour two small sandwich sized “pancakes” into your pan (on just under medium heat). It will only spread just a little bit. When the tops start to bubble just a little and the bottom is brown, flip them both over. Put the cheese and other sandwich contents on one slice, and then put the second flatbread on top with the un-done side up. I recommend buttering the top piece while you wait to flip it. Flip when the bottom is brown, and continue cooking till the cheese is melted and the flatbread is done! This recipe makes 2 sandwich flatbreads. You can double (or more) the recipe. The extras will keep in the fridge for a day or so (you can toast them or heat them back up in the pan… or eat them cold!).
5. This flatbread is not crunchy like regular bread when made into grilled cheese. It has a great flavor and wonderful bread-y texture. It gets more and more crispy as you add more butter (so I recommend being liberal with it!).
6. This morning, I made plain grilled cheese, and then for dinner (because I wanted to test the recipe again before I posted it) I made grilled mozzarella and pesto!! Both were great, and I already have a few more combinations brewing in my head (roasted red peppers….swiss cheese…pizza….).
