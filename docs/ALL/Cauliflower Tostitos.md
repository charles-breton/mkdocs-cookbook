# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Separate the cauliflower into florets, taking care not to break them apart too much. Cut each floret into slices, 1/8″ thick. Lay the slices out on the baking sheet, drizzle with olive oil and season with salt. Roast for 20-30 minutes, until browned and crispy.
2. While the cauliflower is roasting, place the pepper on a baking sheet and place in the oven along with the cauliflower. Roast the pepper until blistered all around, turning every 5 minutes or so.  Remove the pepper from the oven and wrap in foil or place in a ziploc bag to steam for a few minutes. Unwrap the pepper and peel back the skin. Discard skin and seeds and slice the pepper into strips.
3. Arrange the cauliflower chips on a platter, top with artichokes, olives and red pepper strips. Garnish with scallions and feta, if desired. Drizzle with harissa cheddar cheese sauce.

## NOTES

If you’d like the cauliflower chips to be very crispy, leave them to roast for an additional 10-20 minutes. Just keep an eye on them to make sure they don’t burn.
