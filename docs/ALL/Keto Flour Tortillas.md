# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium bowl, whisk together all of the ingredients. The batter will be very thin.
2. Heat a 10" non-stick skillet over medium heat. Spray with non-stick spray (I used olive oil).
3. Pour 1/4 cup of the mixture into the center of the pan and swirl the pan until it is coated evenly.
4. Cook until the edges begin to dry and pull up from the pan and the tortilla is beginning to get golden brown, approx 2 to 3 minutes.
5. Carefully lift the edge of the tortilla with a rubber spatula. The center of the tortilla may still be a bit wet, so be patient. Wait until it will easily turn loose and then and turn the tortilla over to the other side. Cook another 2 to 3 minutes until golden brown.
6. Remove to a plate or cutting board.
7. If not eating immediately, or freezing, place a piece of waxed paper between each tortilla and place the tortillas in an airtight container or zip lock baggie.

## NOTES

The spices are completely up to you and your taste!

   Be sure to check the brands of spices you use because many have "hidden carbs". I usually use the McCormick brand.

   I usually make a double batch and freeze the tortillas. They thaw out very quickly.
