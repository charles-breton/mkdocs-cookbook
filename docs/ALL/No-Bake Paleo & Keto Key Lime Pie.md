# INSTRUCTIONS

#### For the keto graham cracker crust

1. Lightly toast almond flour in a skillet or pan over medium heat, until fully golden and fragrant (2-4 minutes). This is very important taste-wise, so don't skip!
2. Transfer toasted almond flour to a medium bowl, and mix in sweetener, cinnamon and salt. Add in butter, mix until thoroughly combined, and press into an 8 or 9-inch pie dish. Allow to come to room temperature and freeze while you make the pie filling. 

#### For the keto key lime pie

1. Blend all the filling ingredients (starting with the lower amounts) together using an immersion blender (or high speed blender) until creamy smooth. Taste for sweetness, tanginess and seasoning and adjust accordingly. Key limes can vary a lot in taste, so start with the lower amount and add to taste (keeping in mind that the flavors will develop while chilling).
2. Spread the key lime filling over the graham crust lined pie and refrigerate preferably overnight (the key lime kick becomes so much better!). But if in a pickle you can always pop it in the freezer for an hour or so. 
3. Keep in the fridge for 3-4 days, and frozen for a month or two.

## NOTES

* Please **see section on Sweeteners** for more deets on powdering and sweetening options.

Though if using xylitol, make sure to be careful if you have a pup around the house, as it’s highly toxic to the little guys! 🐕

****Coconut cream** is the thick part of your [full-fat canned coconut milk](https://amzn.to/2tMVdH4), and it's easiest to separate it by refrigerating the unopened can overnight and scooping out the cream, discarding the water. 

Please note that nutrition facts were estimated per slice, assuming a yield of 10 slices. And, you can always lower the carb count by decreasing the thickness of the crust (you can get away with even 1-1 1/2 cup of almond flour).
