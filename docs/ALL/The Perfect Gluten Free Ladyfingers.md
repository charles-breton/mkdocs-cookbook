# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pre-heat the oven to 355ºF (180ºC) and line two baking sheets with baking paper.
2. In a stand mixer, or using a hand mixer with the double beater attachment, whip 2 egg yolks and 1/2 of the granulated sugar until increased in volume, pale and fluffy.
3. In a separate bowl, whip 3 egg whites and the other 1/2 of the granulated sugar until you get a stiff-peak meringue.
4. Fold the egg yolks into the egg whites until just incorporated. (_Make sure you don't knock out to much air during mixing!_)
5. Sift the gluten free flour, cornstarch, xanthan gum and baking powder into the egg mixture. Fold everything together until no flour clumps remain, but make sure not to lose too much air during mixing.
6. Transfer the cookie batter into a piping bag with a large round nozzle (_the diameter of the nozzle will determine the thickness of your cookies, so choose appropriately depending on what size of cookies you want_), and pipe about 4 inch (10 cm) long lines of batter onto the lines baking sheets.
	(Make sure to leave about 3/4 inch (2 cm) space between the cookies.)
7. Mix together the powdered and granulated sugars and, using a sieve, generously dust the piped ladyfinger cookies.
    (_You will inevitably get sugar all over the baking sheet, not just on top of the cookies – that's alright! The sugar on the baking sheet will caramelise in the oven but shouldn't affect the cookies._
8. Bake in the pre-heated oven at 355ºF (180ºC) for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 300ºF (150ºF) and bake for a further 12 - 15 minutes.
    (_The second baking at the lower temperature is important, as it ensures that the cookies dry out and become crisp._)
9. Cool on a cooling rack and enjoy!
10. The gluten free ladyfingers keep well in a closed container in a cool dry place for about 1 - 2 weeks.
