# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line an 8 x 8 pan with greaseproof paper or tin foil, with some overlay for easy removal. Grease it lightly and set aside. [Dans le plus petit plat à charnière que nous avons (9”)]
    
2. In a microwave safe bowl or stovetop, combine your chopped chocolate with coconut oil and melt together- The mixture should be silky smooth.
    
3. Transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl and add your eggs and coconut palm sugar and mix until fully incorporated. Add your cocoa powder and arrowroot powder and whisk VERY well, until the batter is no longer grainy and smooth. Add the nuts and transfer to lined baking dish.
    
4. Bake the brownies for 20-25 minutes, or until the centre just comes out clean. Do not over bake. Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the pan completely. If possible, once cooled, transfer to the fridge to chill for the best texture. [30 minutes, ensuite fermer le four et laisser les brownies pour un bon bout.]

## NOTES

1. Do not over bake- Brownies may not look 'cooked' but once cooled, they will firm up.
    
2. Brownies can be kept for up to 5 days in the fridge and are freezer friendly.

## TIPS

Do not over bake- Brownies may not look ‘cooked’ but once cooled, they will firm up.  
Brownies can be kept for up to 5 days in the fridge and are freezer friendly.

* I used a semi sweet chocolate bar (78% cocoa content). Be sure the chocolate bar is finely chopped

** White sugar or coconut palm sugar works best. To keep it sugar-free, use allulose. 

*** To substitute the eggs, use egg replacer- NOT flax eggs or chia eggs. 

**TO STORE**: Brownies will keep at room temperature, covered, for up to 3 days. If you’d like the brownies to keep longer (and be extra chewy!), store them in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. 

**TO FREEZE**: Place leftovers in a ziplock bag and store them in the freezer for up to 6 months. Let them thaw overnight in the refrigerator before enjoying them.
