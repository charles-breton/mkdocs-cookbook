# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Cut the ends of the zucchini, summer squash, sweet potato and beet. Spiralize them using a small, 3 millimeter blade.
    
2. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the coconut oil, apple cider vinegar, coconut aminos and sriracha sauce to the pan. Heat them for a few minutes, then add the vegetable noodles.
    
3. Toss the ingredients to coat the vegetables with the sauce. Cook for five to seven minutes until the noodles are al dente.
    
4. Remove the skillet from the stovetop and transfer the dish to a bowl. Garnish with chopped pistachios and parsley to serve.

## TIPS

- Add 1 tablespoon of grass fed butter to the sauce to make it extra rich and delicious.
    
- If you really want to turn up the heat, add crushed red pepper flakes to the sauce. It will add an extra layer of spice!
