Huckleberries are a hard-to-find, delicious treat, and finding recipes that use them can be even harder. I came up with this recipe for huckleberry muffins as a variation of my favorite blueberry muffin recipe, and they truly are delicious! If you can't find huckleberries, blueberries work well.

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 15 muffin cups or line with muffin papers.
    
2. In a large bowl, cream together sugar and butter until smooth. Mix in milk, egg, and vanilla until well blended. Combine 1 3/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt; stir into batter until just moistened. Toss huckleberries with 1 tablespoon flour to coat, then fold them into batter. Spoon batter into muffin cups, filling at least 2/3 full.
