# INSTRUCTIONS

#### For the black garlic aioli:

1. Using a mortar and pestle, mash the garlic and salt together to create a paste.
    
2. In a bowl, whisk the yolk and lemon juice, and then pour the mixture into the food processor.
    
3. With the food processor running, slowly drizzle in the olive oil until it’s fully incorporated and the mixture is emulsified.
    
4. Add the garlic paste, and then pulse to combine the ingredients. Pour the aioli in a bowl then set aside.
    

#### **For the Brussels sprouts:**

1. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
    
2. In a bowl, combine the Brussels sprouts and oil. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Gently mix to coat the sprouts.
    
3. Pour the mixture onto a baking sheet and put it in the oven.
    
4. Bake for 10 minutes then stir gently. Bake until the sprouts start to caramelize and turn crispy, about 10 to 15 more minutes.
    
5. Remove the Brussels sprouts from the oven and serve them with the aioli.
