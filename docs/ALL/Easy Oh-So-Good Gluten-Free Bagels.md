# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Egg Wash:

1. Combine egg white and water and beat with a fork to loosen. Set aside.

#### Bagels:

1. Preheat oven 375 deg F (190 C).
    
2. If using toppings for your bagels, like grated Parmesan, prepare it now and set aside until ready to use.
    
3.  Combine all dry ingredients together in a large bowl and stir together with a whisk to mix.

4. Add Greek yogurt.

5. Using a fork or mixing spoon, mix really well to combine all the dry and wet ingredients until a dough forms.

6. Pour dough onto a work surface dusted with tapioca starch. Fold and knead gently a few times to form into a more cohesive dough.

7. Work and shape dough into a flattened ball, using tapioca starch as necessary to prevent dough from sticking to your hands and the work surface.

8. Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces.

## NOTES

#### **Volume Measurements:**
- ¾ cup + 1 tbs + 1 teaspoon tapioca starch
- ¾ cup + 1 ½ teaspoon sorghum flour
- ½ cup + 1 tbs brown rice flour
- Please note that gluten-free recipes work best with weight measurements because they are more precise than volume measurements. Gluten-free baking requires more precision and can be less forgiving than baking with regular all-purpose wheat flour.
- These volume measurements were made from spooning each of the flours into the measuring cups/spoons (so they are not packed) and leveling them off.
- The volume measurements are approximate. Make slight adjustments to the recipe as needed, adding a bit more Greek yogurt or a bit more tapioca starch or brown rice flour to achieve the correct dough consistency.
- Be sure to mix the dry ingredients and the yogurt really well so that everything is well incorporated.
- Keep in mind that this dough is not like wheat-based dough. It will be a bit sticky, so handle it gently and be sure to have tapioca starch easily accessible to dust your hands and the work surface.
- It's important to let the bagels cool completely before slicing to let them firm up properly.
- Bagels will keep for 2-3 days. Pop in the toaster to warm up and soften.
- The bagels toast up well!
- Great with butter and jam, cream cheese, and also perfect for bagel sandwiches!
