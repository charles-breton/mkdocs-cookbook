# INSTRUCTIONS

1. This is super easy! Preheat your oven to 325°F to 350°F. If you are roasting something else at the same time, use that roasting temperature and adjust the time the potatoes are in the oven.
2. Take a bag of baby potatoes (or more). Wash them and trim off any poor spots, then let them dry (or dry them if you’re rushed). Pour a little olive oil over them and toss them with your hands to make sure they are all lightly coated. Put in a baking dish or pan.
3. Take 1 packet of Onion-Roasted Garlic Lipton Soup Mix and roll it a bit with a rolling pin to break up the dried onion bits a little. Then sprinkle in the pan over the potatoes. Stir around to get the potatoes coated with as much of the powder as possible. (Add a small onion cut in very small pieces).
4. Place in oven and roast for 45 minutes to 1 hour, depending on temperature.
