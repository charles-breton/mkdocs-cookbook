## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

1/2 large or 1 small ripe avocado ( a ripe avocado should yield under the pressure of your thumb)

1/2 tsp. organic onion powder

1/4 tsp.Celtic sea salt

1 tsp. lemon juice

2 or more fresh Romaine leaves

1/4 cup of your favorite raw organic salsa from the health food store or fresh chopped tomatoes



# INSTRUCTIONS

Use a fork to mash the avocado and seasonings. Place the guacamole in the lettuce leaf and top with salsa or tomatoes and sprouts. Wrap it up and eat it like a burrito.

**Stretch those avocados! If you just don't have enough ripe avocados to make guacamole here's a little trick: For every medium avocado you use, blend 1 stalk of celery and 2 tsp. avocado or olive oil until creamy, then mix with the avocado (a great way to get kids to eat celery too).
