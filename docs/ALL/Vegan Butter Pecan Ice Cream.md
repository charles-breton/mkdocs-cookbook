My favorite ice cream flavor is Butter Pecan. I love the rich taste of toasted pecans and vanilla. The past few weekends I’ve been working on a **Vegan Butter Pecan Ice Cream**. This recipe is very simple but delivers a tasty and delicious treat. I hope you enjoy!

## PREP

**Prep Time:** 20 minutes

**Chill Time:** may vary depending on technique

**Ice Cream Maker Time:**about 25 minutes


# INGREDIENTS

**Makes:** 1 quart (4 cups)
- 2 13.5-oz. cans full fat coconut milk
    
- ½ cup coconut palm sugar (more or less to taste)
    
- 1 vanilla bean, split lengthwise
    
- 2 tbsp vegan butter
    
- ½ tsp salt
    
- 1 tbsp vegan butter
    
- 1 cup pecans, roughly chopped
    
- 1 tbsp gluten-free vodka, _optional_

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Melt 1 tbsp of vegan butter into a nonstick saucepan. Cook the pecans over low heat for about 3 minutes, until they are fragrant and lightly browned. Transfer pecans to a paper towel and allow to cool completely.
    
2. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean and place into a medium saucepan with coconut milk, sugar, 2 tbsp vegan butter and salt, bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat and chill the mixture completely.
    
3. Once coconut mixture has chilled, transfer to a blender and add ⅓ cup of toasted pecans and vodka. Blend until pecans become very fine. If you want the ice cream to be even smoother, drain mixture through a sieve to remove any large pieces of pecan.
    
4. Pour liquid into your ice cream machine bowl, and churn for about 25 minutes, or according to manufacturer’s instructions. The last 5 minutes drop in the remaining pecans. Serve immediately.
    
5. If you’d like a firmer consistency, transfer into a freezer safe container with lid, and freeze for about two hours to thicken.
