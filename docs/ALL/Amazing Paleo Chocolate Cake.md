# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit.
2. Grease three 8-inch cake pans and line the bottom with parchment paper. I prefer to grease my pans with ghee or organic palm shortening as coconut oil can leave a slight coconut taste. Set these aside.
3. Add all of the dry ingredients to a very large mixing bowl and whisk together.
4. Add all of the wet ingredients to a separate medium mixing bowl and whisk together. Then, pour the wet ingredients into the dry and whisk together for 1-2 minutes to create your cake batter.
5. Evenly divide the batter between the three baking pans and cook for 28-30 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
6. Once the cake has completely cooled, assemble the cake by adding the chocolate buttercream frosting between each layer and frosting the outside.

## NOTES

## TIPS

- My baking time of 28-30 minutes is based on a standard oven. I’d recommend checking the cakes earlier, at 23-24 minutes if your oven tends to cook fast or if you’re using a convection oven.
- You can also use two 9-inch cake pans for a two-layer cake (the layers will be thicker). Bake them for approximately 35 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean.
- Remember to make sure your cake is 100% cool before frosting. Even the slightest amount of internal heat in the layers will cause the frosting to melt.
- This is the brand of [espresso powder](https://amzn.to/2K4t6Mz) that I use.
- For substitutions and storing, make sure to read the tips in the post above.
