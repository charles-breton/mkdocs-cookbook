# INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ] First, make the pancakes. Heat a griddle or lightly greased nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat and preheat your oven to 200°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with unbleached parchment paper, and set it aside.
- [ ] In a large bowl, place the buckwheat flour, all purpose gluten free flour, xanthan gum, salt and baking soda, and whisk to combine well. Add the palm sugar, and whisk again to combine, working out any lumps. Create a well in the center of the dry ingredients, and add the butter, yogurt and milk. Whisk until smooth. The batter should be pourable. Pour as many portions of about ¼ cup of batter onto the hot griddle as can fit comfortably, without touching. Allow to cook until large bubbles begin to break through the top of the batter in each pancake and the edges are set (about 1 ½ minutes). Flip over, and continue to cook until set (about another 2 minutes). Remove to the prepared baking sheet, and place the baking sheet in the warm oven until ready to serve. Repeat with the remaining batter.
- [ ] To make the chocolate sauce, in a small, heavy-bottom saucepan, place all of the ingredients for the sauce except the vanilla and whisk to combine well. Place over medium-high heat and cook, stirring frequently, until it comes to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook until the sauce has thickened enough that the sauce will coat the back of a spoon without running right off (about 5 minutes). Add the vanilla, and mix to combine. Transfer the sauce to a heat-proof container, and allow to cool before serving over the pancakes.
