# INSTRUCTIONS

1. To make the sauteed cauliflower and mushrooms [skillet](https://amzn.to/3YlYb2a): Heat the butter and oil in a large [pan](https://amzn.to/3wSbxXZ) or skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté the onion until softened (about 3 minutes).
2. Add the mushrooms and cook for about 4-5 minutes on all sides. Make sure the mushrooms render as much moisture as possible. Brown them a little more if necessary, to avoid the side dish becoming soggy at the end. Keep an eye on it so they don’t burn either ;)
3. Once mushrooms are well browned, add cauliflower florets. Cook until golden and crispy on the edges, about 8-10 minutes. Veggies must be well browned.
4. Pour in the vegetable stock and cook for 2 minutes, to reduce the sauce slightly.
5. Add thyme, 1 tablespoon of parsley, and garlic. Cook the mushrooms and cauliflower for half a minute, until fragrant. Season generously with salt and pepper, to taste, sprinkle with remaining parsley, and serve the **garlic butter mushrooms and cauliflower skillet** immediately. Enjoy!

## NOTES

## TIPS

- Take your time to brown the onion and mushrooms, almost to the point of caramelization. This makes a difference in flavor and texture!
- Turn this mushroom and cauliflower recipe to 100% vegan by using olive oil instead of butter/ghee.
- **How to choose the best cauliflower**: Look for firm, white, heads of cauliflower with green leaves and minimal brown spots on the leaves and the head itself.
- Try and cut the **cauliflower** florets into a uniform size to ensure even cooking with the mushrooms.
- Clean **mushrooms** by wiping them off with a clean cloth. Avoid using water because they will soak moisture and render a lot of water while cooking.
