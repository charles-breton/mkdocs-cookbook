# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat a large saucepan over medium heat. Add olive oil and onions, stirring occasionally, until the onions turn translucent, about 2-3 minutes. Add potatoes, cover, and heat for another 1 minute with a couple stirs, then add the garlic and cook for 1 minute.
2. Add the broth, asparagus, salt, and pepper. Bring to a gentle boil, then reduce heat and simmer until the vegetables are tender, 10 to 12 minutes.
3. Carefully transfer pot contents to a blender or food processor in batches and blend until smooth. (Use caution as hot soup may splatter.)
4. Serve hot, garnished with fresh chives.
