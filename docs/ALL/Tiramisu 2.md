# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Beat whipping cream, sugar, and vanilla until soft peaks form.
2. Add in [mascarpone cheese](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/mascarpone-cheese-recipe/) and amaretto (if using) and continue to whip to stiff peaks.
3. Dip [ladyfingers](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/homemade-ladyfingers/) [](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/homemade-ladyfingers/)in coffee (and brandy if using) and place in an 8×8 pan to make the first layer – you can fit about 7-9 cookies in each layer. Don't let them soak as the will fall apart, just a quick dunk in the coffee is enough.
4. Spread half of the whipped cream mixture on top of the first layer of ladyfingers. Repeat process with the second layer of ladyfingers and cream mixture.
5. Dust the top of dessert with cocoa powder using a sieve. Refrigerate for about 2-4 hours (it gets even better in the fridge and is a perfect make-ahead dessert).

## NOTES

1 cup Mascarpone Cheese Substitution: Cream together 6 oz. softened [cream cheese](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/how-to-make-cream-cheese/), 2 Tablespoons [sour cream](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/how-to-make-sour-cream/), and 3 Tablespoons heavy cream.  
You can make an egg free sponge cake for this using my egg substitute chart.  
If using alcohol, add the Amaretto to the whipped cheese and cream mix, and the brandy, or rum, to the coffee mix. Use one or the other, or both!

*Make Homemade Ladyfingers including an egg-free recipe!
