# INSTRUCTIONS

[NEW VERSION]

1. Over medium heat in a small pot, melt and combine almond butter and [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DS842HS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DS842HS&linkId=c7c6a23efb8960a932fb1c65ea2cbd27).
    
2. In the same pot, add dried ingredients and stir until well-combined.
    
3. Allow mixture to cool slightly and taste test to determine if additional sweetener is needed. Add more as necessary depending on your preferences.
    
4. Pour mixture into bowl and place in freezer for 90 minutes _OR_ pour into silicone mold (if you choose to use a silicone mold, skip steps #4 and #5 and just allow the fat bombs to solidify in freezer, about 3-4 hours).
    
5. Once solidified, remove bowl from freezer and form into balls. Tip: regularly wash hands under cold water and wipe with dry paper towel to avoid [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DS842HS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DS842HS&linkId=c7c6a23efb8960a932fb1c65ea2cbd27) melting in hands.
    
6. Place formed balls on a flat tray or plate and return to freezer for 15-20 minutes.
    
7. Enjoy!



[OLD VERSION]
1. To a small saucepan over medium heat, add SunButter and coconut oil. Allow ingredients to soften and melt, stirring regularly to combine. Once melted, add remaining ingredients and stir until well-combined before removing pan from heat.
2. Allow mixture to cool slightly before taste testing to determine if additional sweetener is needed. Add 1-2 additional tbsps monk fruit sweetener as desired, depending on your taste preferences.
3. Place silicone mold atop a cutting board or baking sheet (one that will fit in your freezer and be able to sit flat). Pour chocolate mixture into measuring cup (or any glassware that allows you to easily pour) before pouring mixture into silicone mold cavities and then transferring silicone mold with cutting board/baking sheet beneath it to the freezer to chill until solidified, about 1-2 hours, before removing fat bombs from silicone mold cavities. Optionally, you can sprinkle flakey sea salt atop fat bombs for added depth of flavor.

## NOTES

**Where You Can Buy Monk Fruit Sweetener:** I purchase mine from Lakanto and have it delivered. If you want to do this, you can [use discount code REALBALANCED at checkout for 20% OFF your Lakanto order](https://realbalanced.com/powdered-monk-fruit-sweetener). If you’d rather purchase monk fruit sweetener in a store, many grocery stores, especially specialty stores and Costco, carry Lakanto’s monk fruit sweetener.

**Powdered Monk Fruit Sweetener Substitution:** [Classic Monk Fruit Sweetener](https://realbalanced.com/lakanto-classic-monk-fruit-sweetener), [Golden Monk Fruit Sweetener](https://realbalanced.com/lakanto-golden-monk-fruit-sweetener), [erythritol](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014MHI4PY/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B014MHI4PY&linkId=5c4e9a53a2ceabdc2116abdaa21ffdfd), or [Swerve](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LLMUG22/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01LLMUG22&linkId=b791438b1ddc9b27a8725780ca1563d5) can be subbed in here at a 1:1 ratio. If you use any of these granulated sweeteners, I would suggest pulsing the sweetener in a food processor to powder it, although this isn’t essential. You can use [powdered stevia](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DP6513C/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07D41C32Z&linkId=624ba930758c645323ba46e5b8ae4d3e&th=1) or [liquid stevia](https://www.amazon.com/Now-Better-Stevia-Organic-Sweetener/dp/B001K2KR46/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ac_md=0-0-bGlxdWlkIHN0ZXZpYQ==-ac_d_rm&cv_ct_cx=liquid+stevia&dchild=1&keywords=liquid+stevia&pd_rd_i=B001K2KR46&pd_rd_r=4b93dbaf-b74d-4892-9f76-b123d2b1448d&pd_rd_w=sQgWu&pd_rd_wg=4O4zx&pf_rd_p=a0516f22-66df-4efd-8b9a-279a864d1512&pf_rd_r=MTQJ9P1CQ69HH26HABY4&psc=1&qid=1590580980&sr=1-1-12d4272d-8adb-4121-8624-135149aa9081&linkCode=ll1&tag=realba04-20&linkId=ee2bae78f9985d3f1f04e43b58483bdd&language=en_US), but I cannot advise of the exact amount as all brands have very different potency. I personally have made these with pure stevia, which is VERY sweet in very small amounts. I would suggest starting with only 1/4 tsp if you’re using pure stevia, taste testing, and adding more based on your taste preferences.

**SunButter Substitution:** If you can eat nuts, unsweetened creamy peanut butter or unsweetened creamy almond butter can be substituted for SunButter at a 1:1 ratio.

**Coconut Oil Substitution:** If you eat dairy, butter can be used in place of coconut oil at a 1:1 ratio.

**Coconut Flour Substitution:** Almond flour should be able to be substituted for coconut flour, but you will need to adjust the ratios. For the ⅓ cup of coconut flour the recipe calls for, you will likely need to use closer to 1 cup of almond flour. I cannot test this substitution for you because of my allergies, but I think this should work. For a nut-free option, try [ground sunflower seed meal](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079WP5VRG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B079WP5VRG&linkId=b364af7c9039376e66fecdacc8d667ce) and follow the ratio suggestions listed for almond flour.

**How To Make This Recipe Coconut-Free:** Coconuts are not tree nuts. If you are allergic to tree nuts but are unsure if you are also allergic to coconut, talk to your doctor as I am not a medical professional. I just follow the recommendations of my allergist and [what the AAAAI says](https://www.aaaai.org/conditions-and-treatments/library/allergy-library/tree-nut-allergy). If you do have a coconut allergy or are unsure if you have one, follow the ingredient substitution instructions listed above for [coconut oil](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DS842HS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00DS842HS&linkId=c7c6a23efb8960a932fb1c65ea2cbd27) and [coconut flour](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IDCFXG8/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00IDCFXG8&linkId=f0a466b6d105216c69cceca34d377274) to make this recipe coconut-free.

**Unsweetened Cocoa Powder Substitution:** Carob powder can be used as a 1:1 ratio substitute for cocoa powder. If you make this switch, note that the flavor of carob powder is not identical to that of chocolate and the carb content will change.

**Where You Can Find Silicone Molds:** I personally used this [silicone mold with round cavities](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FTO72WA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=realba04-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B01FTO72WA&linkId=f7056a79fa90a00b476c8222654602cd) (these came in a set of 2) and this [silicone mold with rectangular cavities](https://www.amazon.com/Funshowcase-Cavities-Rectangular-Chocolate-Silicone/dp/B00F4HE6XG?dchild=1&keywords=silicone+rectangle+mold&qid=1615141089&sr=8-24-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyTkNBSkJVUEpCTlo4JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDEwNDE5T1ZMRFlWQVZGT09EJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4MTgyMDYyRDZQMzFZMzQ3UThLJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfbXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&linkCode=ll1&tag=realba04-20&linkId=febd43ca13e42a47171735f8e975db15&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) (I purchased 2 of these), both of which I bought from Amazon.

**Net Carbs:** There are 0.9 grams of net carbs per serving. 1 fat bomb is equivalent to 1 serving. Net carbs are calculated by taking the total carb content, subtracting fiber, and subtracting sugar alcohols.

**Refrigerator Storage:** Store fat bombs in the refrigerator in an airtight container for up to 1 week. Depending on the temperature of your refrigerator, the fat bombs may get too soft. If that happens, I would suggest storing them in your freezer based on the recommendations listed below.

**Freezer Storage: Store fat bombs in the freezer in an airtight container for up to 3 months. I would suggest laying them in layers and separating the layers with sheets of parchment paper to avoid them all sticking together. When you’re ready to eat them, pull out the amount you want and let them sit at room temperature for a few minutes to slightly thaw before eating.**
