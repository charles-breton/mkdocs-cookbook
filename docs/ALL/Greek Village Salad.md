# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash, core and cut tomatoes into bite-size or smaller pieces. Peel cucumber (or wash very well); halve lengthwise and cut into 1/4” slices. Cut red onion into chunky pieces OR medium-size slivers. Dice green pepper. Add olives, cheese and seasonings. Add oil and mix well.
2. Add some good fresh bread and this will make a main dish salad for two, or side salads for four or five.

## NOTES

The seasonings are according to taste, so these are rough estimates of what we use. You can use all or none of the optional seasonings. If you add lots of Kalamata olives, feta and/or capers, you probably won’t need to add any regular salt.
  
*Superstore carries a creamy feta that we can cut into pieces and add to the salad. When it is mixed, some of it will ‘melt’ into the dressing, giving it a more creamy look and flavor.
  
This salad is traditionally served in the middle of the table with everyone eating out of the same bowl. Bread is spread around the table to be eaten with the meal and used to sop up the juices that accumulate at the bottom of the salad bowl. The best bread is a chewy baguette, but french bread is good also.
