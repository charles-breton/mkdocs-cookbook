# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Break up the chocolate into a heatproof bowl. You can either melt it in the microwave, stirring every minute or so, or you can place it on top of a small pan of simmering water until it has completely melted.
2. Mix in the tahini/nut-butter, then fold in the quinoa pops.
3. Divide the mixture between 18 mini doughnut rings. Place in the fridge for 1-2 hours or until the chocolate has set.

## NOTES

* You can use any crunchy cereal, but the weight may vary. For example when using protein crispies, 1 cup = 75g. When using quinoa pops, 1 cup = 25g. You basically need 1 cup of crunchy cereal for this recipe.

** Store in an air-tight container in the fridge. You can freeze any leftovers.
