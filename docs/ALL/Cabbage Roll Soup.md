# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large pot, over medium heat, heat the butter (or ghee) and olive oil. Add garlic and onion and cook until the onion is translucent and the garlic is fragrant. 
    
2. Add ground beef and pork, brown, and drain any excess grease. 
    
3. Add the cabbage and the spices, cook a few minutes, and then add the remaining ingredients and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and simmer for 30-45 minutes.

## NOTES

- To further cut down on carbs, you can omit the tomato paste and one can of the diced tomatoes. 
    
- Ground turkey can be subbed for the ground beef and pork for a flavor or nutritional variation. 
    
- This recipe can also be made in the crockpot. (Suggested to cook on high for 3-4 hours)
    
- This recipe can easily be frozen and reheated when needed. 
    
- Some folks opt to skip the cauliflower rice and still find the soup to be just as tasty.
