# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 114 g unsalted grass-fed butter melted & slightly cooled (or 7 TBS coconut oil + 1 TBS coconut cream)
- [ ] 140-200 g [allulose](https://amzn.to/3vVjERQ) xylitol or erythritol (I use 1 cup for allulose and 2/3 cup for xylitol and erythritol!)
- [ ] 130 g [unsweetened, salted peanut butter](https://amzn.to/2CeftGP)
- [ ] 2-3 eggs at room temperature**
- [ ] 2 teaspoons [vanilla extract](http://amzn.to/2gVTsV4)
- [ ] 130 g [almond flour](https://amzn.to/2q1v6KO) ***
- [ ] 1/2-3/4 teaspoon [kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uM2LxM) depending on how seasoned your pb is
- [ ] 3/4 teaspoon [baking powder](https://amzn.to/2EfL5K2)
- [ ] 2/3 cup [dark chocolate chips](http://amzn.to/2BkiqSX) or chunks (or both!)

#### To garnish

- [ ] [flakey sea salt](https://amzn.to/2q0OE1L) optional (but highly suggested!)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. See recipe video for guidance!
2. Position a rack in the lower third of your oven and preheat to 350°F/180°C. Line with parchment paper a 9x9-inch baking pan. Set aside. 
3. Add butter, sweetener and peanut butter to a large bowl and whisk until thoroughly combined, the mixture will be very thick. 
4. Add one egg at a time, whisking well after each one until completely incorporated. The texture should appear smooth, with most of the sweetener (xylitol) dissolving into the mixture. Erythritol doesn't dissolve much, which is why you want to use powdered form (or DIY in a blender!). Whisk in the vanilla extract. 
5. Add the almond flour, salt and baking powder and whisk vigorously until fully blended (about a minute).  The mixture will be very thick! Fold in chocolate chips (optional, but highly suggested!), transfer batter to prepared baking dish, and top-off with chocolate chunks and flakey sea salt (again, optional but highly suggested). 
6. Bake for 20-27 minutes (I do about 25), until the center is just set. This really does vary (a lot!!) from oven to oven (think convection etc), so give them a check from minute 15 the first time around, and remember that you're blondies will continue to cook while they cool. 
7. Sprinkle with flakey sea salt (optional) and allow to cool completely on a rack. Lift blondies using the edges of the parchment paper and cut into desired size (I do 16!). 
8. Store in an airtight container for about 5 days and in the freezer for a month.

## NOTES

**Check out the following notes** to be sure the pb blondies come out to your taste buds' desire! 

*Please see section on sweeteners for deets and possible substitutions. My top choice is [xylitol](https://amzn.to/2xAOjYk) (non-corn though to avoid tummy troubles!), or [golden erythritol](https://amzn.to/2zsjzKw) as a runner-up. 

****2 or 3 eggs, that is the question!** Use **2 for a denser blondie** and **3 for a more cake-like one**. I actually prefer 3 here as the crumb ends up impossibly tender and moist, but they're awesome with 2 as well if you're into extra fudgy goodies. 

*** You can either do all almond flour, or do 1 cup [almond](https://amzn.to/2QYXf1R) and 1/3 cup [peanut flour](https://amzn.to/2DtV7MI). I've tried both and might lean towards the combo, as you get an even stronger PB kick. But if you don't have any peanut flour handy (and I'm assuming most of you don't!), just don't sweat it and do all almond! But **if you love them** (and I’m fairly certain you will!), come back and purchase the [peanut flour](https://amzn.to/2DtV7MI). Because these blondies are **bound to become household staples**.
