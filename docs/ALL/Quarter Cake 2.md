# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, grease and flour a 22cm, round sandwich tin or use a ‘magical’ silicone one.
2. Beat all the ingredients together in a mixer on high for 2 minutes or so, scraping the sides of the bowl halfway through.
3. Tip the mixture into the tin and bake for 25-30 minutes, until it is beautifully golden and just coming away from the sides of the tin.
4. Remove from the oven, let it cool slightly then turn out onto a wire rack and leave to cool completely.
