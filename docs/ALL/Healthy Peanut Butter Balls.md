# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 1/4 cups (320 grams) natural peanut butter (no added fat or sugar)

- [ ] 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon salt
- [ ] 1/4 cup (32 grams) coconut flour

- [ ] 1 tablespoon (14 grams) coconut oil â€“ I used refined for no coconut taste

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium mixing bowl, stir together the peanut butter, maple syrup, vanilla and salt until combined. Stir in the coconut flour. Place in the freezer for about 30 minutes. The dough won't get very hard in the freezer - it'll just make it easier to roll into balls. The balls won't be totally firm when you form them but that's okay. They don't need to be totally perfect.
2. Prepare the coating. Mix together chopped chocolate and coconut oil in a small bowl or pot that can be used to melt the chocolate and dip the balls in.
3. Shape into about 28 20-gram balls and place on a tray small enough to fit in your freezer. Place them in the freezer to let them firm up more (since rolling with warm hands heats them up quickly).
4. Dip the balls one at a time into melted chocolate, allowing excess to drip off. Place on a waxed paper-lined baking sheet, cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.
5. Refrigerate for up to a week or freeze for a few months. Can also be kept at room temperature for a few days (if it's not too warm).
