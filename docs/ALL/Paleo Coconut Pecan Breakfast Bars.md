# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350. Use the coconut oil to grease an 8×8 pan.Crack your eggs into a medium sized bowl and quickly whisk. Mash your banana – I like to just do this quickly on a plate – add to the bowl with the eggs along with the honey and vanilla.Measure and add your coconut flour, making sure to combine everything well and ensuring there are no clumps.Measure and add the unsweetened shredded coconut and coconut milk and mix to ensure the batter is well combined.Spoon the batter into your pan and smooth it out. Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the top.Bake your bars in the pre-heated oven to 20-25 minutes until the edges and golden brown and the center is firm.Freezing these is a cinch! Simply wait for them to cool, cut them to the desired size and store them in a freezer container or freezer bag. I tend to try to do this as soon as I can.You can defrost them quickly by popping them in the microwave for about 30 seconds.
