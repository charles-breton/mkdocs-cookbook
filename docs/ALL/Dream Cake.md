# INGREDIENTS

#### **For the crust** (For the big Pyrex we used)
##### **Version with nuts** (that’s what we had):

- [ ] 4 cups of walnuts
- [ ] 1/4 tsp of salt
- [ ] 6 tbsp coconut sugar
- [ ] 1/2 cup melted butter
- [ ] Blend et press on bottom of the desired plate. Bake at 325 F for 20 minutes.
- [ ] Let cool completely before adding the rest of the ingredients.

##### **Version with flour**

- [ ] 4 cups of graham crumbs (follow instructions on the bag or box)

#### **For the cream**

- [ ] 40 marshmallows
- [ ] 1 cup of water
- [ ] 1 L of whipping cream
- [ ] Put the marshmallows and water in a pot and melt at low temperature. Let cool completely. (To accelerate the process you can put the pot in cold water)
- [ ] Whip the cream (stop a little before it is totally thickened) and add the cold marshmallows mixture. Whip a little more.

#### **For the fruits**

 - [ ] You either buy 20 oz of fruits filling in the baking aisle or you make it yourself. See below for the recipe.

##### **Thickened berries**:

- [ ] 7 cups frozen berries
- [ ] 1 cup of cane sugar
- [ ] 1 tbsp of lemon juice
- [ ] 4 tbsp of cornstarch or 3 1/2 tbsp of tapioca flour if you prefer not to have corn

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. _Add berries, sugar and lemon juice to a large saucepan over medium heat. 
2. Simmer, until warm and juicy, about 5-10 minutes, gently stirring occasionally. (You can taste it at this point and see if it's sweet enough for your liking. If you want it sweeter you can add 1/4 cup more sugar.)
3. _Spoon out about 1/2 cup of the juice from the pan into a bowl. Stir cornstarch (or tapioca starch is using) into the juice until smooth. 
4. _Bring pot of berries back to a simmer and slowly pour in the cornstarch. Gently stir mixture (being careful not to mash the berries), until thickened, about 2-5 minutes.
5. Let cool before using.

**Assemblage**

- [ ] Put a little less than half of the whipped cream on the crust, put the fruits on top and then the remaining whipped cream. If the graham crumbs are used you can put some crumbs on top. Let cool completely in the fridge for at least 2 hours.
