# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 170C / 340F and grease two 12-hole muffin trays (to make cupcakes) or a springform pan (to make a cake).
2. Place the oranges in a saucepan and cover with cold water.  Place lid onto the saucepan and bring to the boil, then uncover and allow to simmer for 15 minutes.  Drain the water, then repeat once more.  
3. Drain the cooking water from the oranges, then place the oranges on a cutting board. Chop oranges into quarters and remove the skin off 1 orange, leaving the skin on the other.  Remove any visible pith and seeds, then place in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.  
4. Next, place eggs and sugar in a large mixing bowl and beat with a hand mixer until pale, fluffy and doubled in size.  
5. Add the orange mixture, vanilla, baking powder and almond meal into the bowl and mix well.
6. Spoon the mixture into the muffin trays, filling each hole ⅔ of the way, then cook for 15-20 minutes or until golden with springy tops and a skewer comes out clean. 
7. Leave in the pan for 10 minutes, then move to a rack to cool.
8. Serve as is, or sprinkle over icing / powdered sugar.

## NOTES

**Storing Orange Almond Cupcakes**

Store any leftover orange and almond cakes in an airtight container in the fridge.  Because they are made with fresh fruit they have a short self life and will need to be consumed within 3 days.

## TIPS

- **TO MAKE A CAKE** - Pour the mixture into the springform pan, then cook for 45-60 minutes, until golden and a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool in the pan for 20 minutes.
- Don't have two muffin trays?  You can use silicone cupcake cases or just cook in batches.

- Don't skip the boiling oranges step.  This will stop them being bitter and leaving a sour taste in your cupcakes!  The water you boil the oranges in can either be thrown out or if you want to get creative - save it and pour it into a warm bath.  It smells divine! 

- If you're wanting the cakes to be gluten-free make sure you use a gluten-free baking powder.
- Serve cupcakes as is or with icing / powdered sugar sifted on top. 
- Store leftovers in an airtight container the fridge for a few days, or freeze for a few months.
