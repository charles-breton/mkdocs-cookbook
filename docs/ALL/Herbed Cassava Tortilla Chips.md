# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make the recipe for [cassava flour tortillas](https://downshiftology.com/recipes/cassava-flour-tortillas/), stopping when you have a large ball of dough. At that point, knead in the three herbs and garlic until well combined. Then, continue cooking as per the tortilla recipe. Tip: roll the dough extra thin for crispy chips.
2. Once your tortillas are cooked and cooled, slice them into 6 equal pieces.
3. Lightly oil a sheet pan with half the avocado oil. Place the individual tortilla chips on the sheet pan and brush the top side with the remaining oil. Sprinkle the salt on top.
4. Heat the oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit and cook the chips for 10-15 minutes, or until crispy. Turn your pan halfway through to prevent any chips from burning. Remove, let cool and enjoy!
