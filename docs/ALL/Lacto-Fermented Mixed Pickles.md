- [ ] 1 clove garlic, smashed and peeled

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine water and salt until the salt is dissolved.
  
2. All remaining ingredients go in a (very) clean, 1/2â€“gallon jar
  
3. Pour the salt water over the vegetables, leaving 1 inch of space at the top, making sure the vegetables are covered. Cover the jar tightly and let it stand at room temperature.
  
4. Once a day or so, open the jar to taste the pickles and release gases produced during fermentation. If any mold or scum has formed on the top, simply skim it off.
  
5. When pickles taste the way you like them, refrigerate the jar. They will continue to ferment very slowly. The cold will pretty much stop the fermentation process.
