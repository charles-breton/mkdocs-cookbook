# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Dice up the shrimp and scallops to preferred serving size and place in a glass bowl.
    
2. Combine juices from oranges, limes and lemons and pour over the shrimp and scallops.
    
3. Add the diced onion, minced garlic and peppers (if you’re using them) and mix well.
    
4. Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. You will be able to tell when the seafood is done cooking in the juices when the shrimp are pink and the scallops are opaque.
    
5. After mixture has been in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, remove bowl from refrigerator and add remaining ingredients, except for the avocado and cilantro, and mix.
    
6. Cover and place back in the refrigerator for an hour so flavors can meld together.
    
7. Mix in the diced avocado and cilantro before serving.
