###### *RELATED* : 

While your diet should contain colorful organic vegetables, ideally it should include moderate amounts of high-quality animal protein, which are valuable sources of nutrients that cannot be obtained elsewhere.

However, I advise you to avoid meats from [confined animal feeding operations](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/truth-about-factory-farms.htm) (CAFOs), usually sold in supermarkets. They come from animals raised in poor living conditions (compared to free-range animals) and usually are fed a diet filled with genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

They also are often nutritionally inferior and contaminated with growth hormones, antibiotics and pathogens. Opt for organic pastured meats, which are not only healthier but are also leaner and tastier. Discover the nutrition and flavor of these organic meats in the recipe below_._


## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

2 1/4 pounds beef tenderloin or ostrich

1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, packed

1 1/2 Tbsp fresh thyme

1 Tbsp fresh oregano

3 garlic cloves

2 Tbsp Dijon mustard

1/8 Tsp black pepper

1/4 cup extra virgin coconut oil

1/2 teaspoon Himalayan sea salt



# INSTRUCTIONS

To prepare the beef, trim off excess fat using a sharp knife. Fold the thin tip under to approximate the thickness of the rest of the tenderloin. 

Tie with butcher’s twine, then keep tying the roast with twine every 2 inches or so. This helps the roast keep its shape.

In the bowl of a food processor, combine the basil, thyme, oregano, garlic, mustard and pepper. 

While the food processor is running, slowly drizzle in the oil and continue to process until the herbs and garlic are finely chopped.

Rub the herb mixture over the beef and refrigerate for four to 24 hours.

Preheat the oven 425 F. Place the beef on an oiled baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 137 F (medium rare). 

Remove from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Slice and serve.
