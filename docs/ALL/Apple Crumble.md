# INGREDIENTS

For a container 15x10 in (adjust the recipe if you use a smaller container)

- [ ] 2/3 cup flour (I use brown rice flour or any gluten free (GF) flour)
- [ ] 4 cups quick oat meal (I use Sprouted oat meal (Costco) to facilitate the digestion and it is GF]
- [ ] 2 cups of brown sugar (I use coconut sugar)
- [ ] 1 cup butter softened (not melted)
- [ ] Apples (quantity needed to fill the container of your choice)
- [ ] Cinnamon
- [ ] Lemon juice (optional) (I rarely put any)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix the flour, oat meal, brown sugar and butter in a bowl and set aside. Peel and cut the apples and fill your container. To the apples, add cinnamon to taste and lemon juice if you want. Add the oat meal mixture on top and bake at 350F for about 30-35 minutes until your apples are soft and the top is to your liking.
2. ENJOY!
