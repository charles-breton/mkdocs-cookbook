# INSTRUCTIONS

#### CAKE

1. Remove a rack from the oven for the cooling part and preheat the oven at 350F. Butter and flour the 9” round cake pans. Put butter in a mixing bowl and beat a few minutes. Add sugar gradually, and beat 3-5 minutes until light and fluffy to put lots of air in the mixture. Scrape down the sides. Add vanilla first and then egg yolks gradually. Mix flour, baking powder (and salt?) and add this dry mixture in 3 additions (about 1 cup each) alternating with 2 additions of milk (½ cup each). Mix well.
2. Divide the batter in the cake pans and bake 22 to 28 minutes until  a toothpick inserted in the centre comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes before removing the cakes from the pans and then let the cakes cool completely on a rack.

#### FROSTING

1. **Procedure for the frosting**
2. Put the chocolate in a heat resistant bowl and melt over a pot of hot water (bain-marie). Let it cool at room temperature. 
3. Meanwhile, beat the butter and add 2 cups of icing sugar. Add the vanilla and the cooled melted chocolate. Mix well. 
4. P.S. If not thick enough, add more icing sugar.
