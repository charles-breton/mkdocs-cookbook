3. Pour the honey garlic sauce mixture evenly on top.
4. Cover the slow cooker and seal the lid. Cook on a LOW setting for 6-8 hours or on HIGH for 3-3 1/2 hours (see note).
5. About 20 minutes before serving, add the green beans to the slow cooker and optional cornstarch slurry to the sauce.
6. Re-seal the lid and cook for 15-20 minutes more until the green beans are tender and the sauce is starting to thicken.

8. Drizzle sauce on top of chicken and vegetables. Garnish with optional minced parsley.

## NOTES

- Use a quality soy sauce brand such as Kikkoman or San-J to get the best results. Low-grade soy sauce will affect the flavor of the dish.
- Due to variations among crock pot brands, check doneness at the early end of the time range.
- For a healthier option, pour the sauce into a [fat separator](https://amzn.to/2Jh3D0e) before adding cornstarch. Separate out the fat and use only the remaining liquid for the thickening step.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat on the stovetop or in the microwave on medium power. Do not freeze.
