# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line an [8-inch square baking pan](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923064154/https://amzn.to/2xr1exA) with wax paper or parchment paper. Clear some space in the freezer for this pan—you will need it later. Set aside at room temperature.
2. **Make the peanut butter layer:** In a medium bowl, add **Peanut Butter Layer** ingredients: 2/3 cup peanut butter, ¼ cup maple syrup, and 1/3 cup coconut flour. Whisk until thickened and difficult to stir. Switch to folding with a rubber spatula until well-incorporated.
3. Pour this peanut butter mixture into the prepared baking pan. Using the rubber spatula, smooth into an even layer. Set aside.
4. **Make the chocolate topping:** Use the double boiler method or the following. Add **Chocolate Topping** ingredients to a medium, microwave-safe bowl: 2/3 cup chocolate chips and 1/3 cup peanut butter. Heat in 20-second increments until chocolate is softened and melty. Stir in between heating, until smooth.
5. Pour the chocolate mixture over the peanut butter filling. Using a clean rubber spatula, smooth chocolate into an even layer. Tap the pan a few times to help even out the chocolate.
6. **Add Peanut Topping:** Sprinkle chopped peanuts over chocolate topping. Set aside while preparing the drizzle.
7. **Drizzle the bars:** In a microwave-safe bowl, add ¼ cup chocolate chips and ¼ teaspoon peanut butter. Heat in 20-second increments until softened and melted. Stir until smooth. Spoon melted chocolate into a small zip bag and trim a tiny corner off; or, spoon chocolate into a [small piping bottle](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923064154/https://amzn.to/2zlcEzS). Pipe chocolate in a zigzag pattern across the top of the bars.
8. Freeze for 45-60 minutes, or until hardened. Remove from freezer and slice into 16 squares.
9. Enjoy! Storing instructions below.

## NOTES

– Adapted from my [4 Ingredient No Bake Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars](https://web.archive.org/web/20200923064154/https://beamingbaker.com/4-ingredient-no-bake-chocolate-peanut-butter-bars-vegan-gluten-free-dairy-free/).  
– On the first day, these bars are best stored in the refrigerator. Serve and enjoy within 1 hour.  
– After the first day, you may store these bars in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for up to 1-2 weeks. Starting week 2, the bars are a bit drier (like Reese’s PB cup filling), but still delicious.  
– These bars freeze well. Store in an airtight container in the freezer for 1-2 months. Thaw at room temperature for 10 minutes before enjoying. Or, heat in the microwave in 10-second increments until softened.
