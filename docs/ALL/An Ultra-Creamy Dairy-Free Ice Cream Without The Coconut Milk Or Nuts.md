We love this dairy-free ice cream for a bunch of reasons. I love it because it doesn’t use coconut milk. Not that I have anything against coconut milk, there’s just a lot of dairy-free ice cream recipes out there that use it, and I like to do things a little differently.

Kevin likes it because it makes him feel good – no sugar crash, no stomach aches, just pure ketone-generating energy. Think of this [sugar-free ice cream](https://web.archive.org/web/20170407085537/http://www.healthfulpursuit.com/tag/ice-cream/) like a fat bomb… but chilled.

## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 4 whole pastured eggs
    
- 4 yolks from pastured eggs
    
- ⅓ cup (50 grams) melted [cacao butter](http://amzn.to/1Ky08ya)
    
- ⅓ cup melted [coconut oil](http://amzn.to/1HAf53T)
    
- ⅓ cup flavor variation *see notes for options
    
- ¼ cup [xylitol](http://amzn.to/1gdtUNN) or 15-20 drops of [alcohol-free stevia](http://amzn.to/1gdtWVU)
    
- ¼ cup [MCT oil](https://bi198.isrefer.com/go/brainoctaneoil/a831/)
    
- 2 tsp [vanilla bean powder](http://amzn.to/1GSEorj)
    
- 8-10 ice cubes


# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add all ingredients but ice cubes into the jug of your [high powered blender](http://amzn.to/1RUAvIp). Blend on high for 2 minutes, until creamy.
    
2. While the blender is still running, remove the top portion of the lid and drop in 1 ice cube at a time, allowing the blender to run about 10 seconds between each ice cube. The goal here is to dilute the mixture just a bit and make it cold so it will run through the ice cream maker easier. If you have a [Vitamix](http://amzn.to/1RUAvIp), there is a small space at the top, just big enough to drop in the ice cube. If you don’t have a hole in your lid, turn off the blender each time as you add an ice cube, one at a time.
    
3. Once all of the ice has been added, pour the cold mixture into your [ice cream maker](http://amzn.to/1JDuIVO) and churn on high for 20-30 minutes, depending on your ice cream maker. If you do not have an ice cream maker, transfer the mixture to [9x5 loaf pan](http://amzn.to/1RUAF2x) and place in the freezer. Set the timer for 30 minutes before taking out to stir. Repeat for 2-3 hours, until desired consistency is met.
    
4. Serve immediately as soft-serve or scoop into a [9x5 loaf pan](http://amzn.to/1RUAF2x) and freeze for 45 minutes or so. Store covered in the freezer for up to a week.

## NOTES


**Ice Cream Maker:**

 I’ve had 

[this Cuisinart Ice Cream Maker](http://amzn.to/1JDuIVO)

 for 4 years and it’s served me well. Under $80 and perfect for summer treats!

**Cacao Butter:**

 is the fat from chocolate. I like purchasing these cacao butter wafers because they’re a lot easier to work with than the chunks.

**Coconut Oil:**

 If you don’t want to use coconut oil in this recipe, you can use an equal amount of additional cacao butter.

**Xylitol:**

 our bodies have the enzyme required to breakdown xylitol, but it requires that we start off slow in our intake. If you don’t want to use xylitol, alcohol-free stevia is another option, or raw honey, or any other sweetener of your choice. I chose xylitol and stevia because it keeps the carb count low.

**Flavor Variations:**

 Use a ⅓ cup of a combination of any of the following, or omit for vanilla ice cream. For variations where spices or teas are involved, use about 1 tablespoon of the spice/tea and the rest of the other ingredient to make up ⅓ cup total. (1) cacao powder (2) cacao powder and ground turmeric (3) cacao powder and chopped fresh mint leaves (4) cacao powder and your favorite tea leaf mixture (5) lucuma and maca (6) cacao powder and ground cinnamon (7) roughly ground almond flour and cacao powder (8) roughly ground almond flour and cacao nibs.

**MCT Oil:**

 if you don’t want to use MCT oil, you could replace with an equal amount of avocado oil or flax oil.
