# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Make the Rub & Prep the Pork

1. Whisk the dijon and mayo in a small bowl together. Add the minced garlic, rosemary, thyme, and 1 teaspoon salt.
2. Rub the rack of pork with the dijon mixture and let rest in the fridge for 6 hours. Bring to room temp on the counter for 30 minutes before cooking.

#### **Prep the Veggies**

3. When ready to cook, Preheat oven to 425
4. Melt 2 tbsp butter in a small saucepan or in the microwave; Set aside.
5. Roughly chop the carrots, turnips, parsnips, and onion and toss in a large bowl with 2 tbsp of the melted butter. Season with 1/2 teaspoon salt. 

#### **Sear the Meat**

6. Heat a heavy roasting pan over medium heat. Add the remaining butter and swirl to coat pan.
7. Sear the pork, fat side down, until golden 3 to 5 minutes.
8. Using tongs, hold the rack up and sear the sides as best you can. Remove the roasting pan from heat and set the pork aside.

#### **Roast the Rack of Pork**

9. Add the veggies to the pan and nestle the pork on top.
[D'une autre recette : Heat oven to 350 F, Roast 18 minutes per pound or to an internal temperature of 145 F. You want the meat to still be pink.  (Ce que j'ai fait le 19 février 2021]
10. Roast the pork in the oven at 425 for 1 to 1 -2 hours until the internal temp reaches 145.
11. Remove from the oven and cover with foil.
12. Let rest for 20 minutes.
13. Slice carefully between the bones and serve.

## NOTES

For an added boost, I used Jacobsen Rosemary Salt 1 of the 2 teaspoons of salt for the mix.

  

To store leftovers, wrap the pork in a double layer of foil. Store in fridge for up to 3 days.  

  

Pork can be reheated in an oven at 325, wrapped in foil.
