1. Mix together sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, and salt in large bowl. 
    
2. Stir in milk, melted butter, and vanilla.

5. Sprinkle over cake batter. 
    
6. Pour boiling water over the top of it all and resist all temptation to stir! DO NOT STIR. 
    
7. Cover and cook on High for 2 - 2 1/2 hours. 
    
8. Remove lid, turn off, and let rest 30 minutes before serving so it isn't so hot!
