# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a KitchenAid mixer (or by hand), combine all of the ingredients for the dough until smooth.
3. Separate the dough into 4 equal parts.
4. Fill a large sauce pan with 2 quarts of water or half way full. Bring the water to a boil and then turn it slightly down, but keep the water boiling.
5. Roll each segment of dough into a ball and then shape it into a bagel. You may have to wet your hands to shape the dough, so it doesn't stick to you.
6. Drop one bagel at a time into the boiling water and let them cook for 1 minute on each side or until they rise to the top of the water.
7. Once the bagels have boiled, set them on the baking tray. If you so desire to put an egg wash on the bagels to make them brown- simply brush the egg wash on top of the bagels and then sprinkle the sesame seeds over the tops of the bagels.
8. Bake the bagels on 350 degrees for 25 minutes until golden brown.
