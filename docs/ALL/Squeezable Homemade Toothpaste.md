# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 5 tablespoons Calcium powder
- [ ] 3 tablespoons Xylitol Powder (This ingredient is not completely necessary, but it keeps the toothpaste from tasting bitter. We don't cook or consume Xylitol, but there is some evidence that it is beneficial orally.)
- [ ] 4 tablespoons coconut oil at room temperature
- [ ] 1 tablespoon baking soda (optional)
- [ ] 2 tablespoons Bentonite Clay or you could use additional Calcium powder
- [ ] 3 tablespoons Distilled Water or slightly more to thin
- [ ] 30+ drops of essential oils of choice: Peppermint, Cinnamon, etc or Brushing Blend
- [ ] Optional: 20-30 drops of trace minerals

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix all ingredients except clay in a mini-food processor and mix well to incorporate. Once smooth, slowly add in the bentonite clay and mix by hand with a plastic utensil (bentonite clay should not come in contact with metal). If you don't have a food processor, you can use an immersion blender or even a whisk/fork in a bowl. Do not use an air-tight blender like a magic bullet as this creates too much pressure.
2. Store the toothpaste in a small jar or a squeezable tube like a BPA free GoTube.
3. Due to the nature of the coconut oil, this homemade toothpaste will be thicker when cooler and thinner when heated, but it should be a squeezable consistency at normal room temperature (70-75 degrees Fahrenheit). If it is too runny or too thick, try adding more water or calcium to achieve the desired thickness. Use essential oils to taste.
4. Use the homemade toothpaste as you would regular toothpaste.
