3. Cut the squash half crosswise. Then, cut both halves lengthwise and use a spoon to scoop out the seeds.
4. Cut the squash into 1-inch cubes.
5. In a mixing bowl, combine the melted fat with the coconut aminos, coconut sugar, and the rest of the spices except for the basil.
6. Add the squash to the mixing bowl, and toss well to coat
7. Roast for 25 minutes, turning the pieces after 15 minutes.
8. Thinly slice the basil by stacking the two leaves, rolling tightly like a cigar, and slicing across to create ribbons. Carefully mix the basil ribbons into the hot squash.
