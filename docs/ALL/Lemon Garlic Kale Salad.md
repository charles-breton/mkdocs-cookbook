# INSTRUCTIONS

1. With your [kale](https://drjockers.com/kale/) bunches, strip the leaves off the stems and slice into small strips.
2. Wash/Soak in water, massaging the kale while you do so. Rinse/drain and set aside in large salad bowl.
3. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the oil, lemon juice, [garlic](https://drjockers.com/use-garlic/), salt, and red pepper flakes.
4. Massage kale leaves in the [lemon](https://drjockers.com/lemon-to-improve-energy/)-oil dressing to soften up the hard outer layer of the kale.  This makes the kale easier to chew and digest.
5. Pour the left-over “dressing” into salad bowl and massage into the kale.
