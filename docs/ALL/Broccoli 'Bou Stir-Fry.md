"One of my favourite stir-fry meals is broccoli beef, so when I found myself with several hundred pounds of Yukon Mountain Caribou this past fall, I figure a 'bou backstrap (see tip) would be an excellent game replacement," says Teddy Cosco, avid fisher, hunter, and full-time assistant professor of mental health and aging at Simon Fraser University


## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 8 oz (225 g) backstrap caribou steak, cut into strips
- 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt
- 1 1/2 Tbsp (22mL) sesame oil
- 1 head broccolini, chopped
- 2 cups (500 mL) snap peas
- 4 Tbsp (60 mL) chopped spring onion, divided
- 1 tsp (5 mL) toasted sesame seeds
- 1 cup (250 mL) cooked rice
- Salt & Pepper, to taste




# INSTRUCTIONS

Season backstrap slices with salt. In a ripping hot cast iron wok, add sesame oil and sear backstrap for 30 seconds, turning them to sear all sides. Remove to plate.

Add broccolini to pan and cook for 4 mins, until almost tender. Add snap peas and 2 Tbsp (30 mL) green onion. Cook for 30 seconds. Return caribou to pan; give a quick stir and sprinkle with remaining green onions, toasted sesame seeds, and salt and pepper to taste

## NOTES


_WHAT’S BACKSTRAP?
Backstrap comes from the caribou’s
longissimus dorsi, the muscle that runs
“along the spine. Beef striploin would be
a good substitution for the lean meat.
TI fe slices should be cut to the classic
length of fajita strips, about 1/2 in
(13 mm) slices.
