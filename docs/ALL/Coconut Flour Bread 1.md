2. In a large bowl mix together eggs, coconut oil, and milk.
3. Add in coconut flour, baking powder, xanthan gum, and salt.
4. Stir until mixture thickens as the coconut flour absorbs the wet ingredients.
5. In a greased bread pan, spread mixture evenly.
6. Bake in the oven for 35-45 minutes. The top of the bread will be golden brown and a toothpick will come out clean when inserted.
7. Allow to cool and enjoy!
