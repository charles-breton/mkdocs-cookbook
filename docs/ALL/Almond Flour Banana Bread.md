## NOTES

The original recipe, published in 2013, did not include arrowroot starch. I’ve found this recipe works best with a small amount of arrowroot flour. You’re welcome to leave it out or use coconut flour instead. It does make a tremendous difference in the final texture of the bread. Keep in mind, you won’t see the addition of arrowroot in the video, as the video was made a few years ago.

**Keto and Low Carb:** This bread is lower in carbs than traditional banana bread recipes. It contains 24 grams of carbohydrates (21 net carbs, carbs minus fiber). Some readers make this recipe as a low-carb or keto banana bread and use 1/2 teaspoon stevia instead of honey or maple syrup for sweetener.

**Muffins:** Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until firm on top.
