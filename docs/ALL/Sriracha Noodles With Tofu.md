# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, lime juice, water, Sriracha sauce, and garlic cloves. Set aside.[J’ai ajouté du gingembre et le reste de marinade pour le tofu parce que j”ai préparé le tofu comme dans la recette de spaghetti Primavera au tofu]
2. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until shimmering hot. Sprinkle tofu with salt and add it to the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl.
3. Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and add yellow onion, white parts of green onion, and shredded carrots. Cook until crisp tender, about 3 minutes. Place in bowl with tofu.
4. Add remaining tablespoon of oil to pan along with cabbage. Cook stirring frequently, until cabbage is wilted. Add green parts of green onion, the noodles, and the tofu/carrot mixture. Pour sauce on top. [Ajout de 2-3 c. Tab de farine de tapioca préalablement mélangée avec de l’eau froide] Stir and cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat.
5. Serve with lime wedges and extra Sriracha sauce.
