## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

2 - 2 1/2 lbs boneless chuck roast, trimmed and cut into 1-2         inch pieces

1 1/2 tsp kosher salt

1 tsp black pepper

2 Tbsp vegetable oil

12 oz dark stout beer (I usually use Guinness)

3 cups beef broth

3 carrots, peeled and cut into 2 inch pieces

2 parsnips, peeled and cut into 1 inch pieces

1 1/4 lb baby Yukon gold potatoes, halved or quartered

1 yellow onion, diced

5 cloves garlic, minced

2 tsp fresh sage, minced

2 Tbsp beef base (better than bouillon)

2 Tbsp tomato paste

1-2 Tbsp prepared horseradish

1 Tbsp softened butter

1 Tbsp all purpose flour

# INSTRUCTIONS

Season beef pieces with 1 1/2 tsp kosher salt and 1 tsp black pepper.  Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over MED-HIGH heat until shimmering, then add beef in a single layer (you may have to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding the pan).  Brown on all sides, about 1-2 minutes per side, then turn off heat.  Remove beef to slow cooker. 

Pour beer and broth into hot pan and stir to loosen any browned bits.  Let sit for a few minutes while you add other ingredients.

Add carrots, parsnips, potatoes, onion, garlic, sage, beef base and tomato paste to slow cooker with the browned beef.  Pour beer/broth mixture from the skillet into the slow cooker.  Cover and cook on LOW for 7 - 7 1/2 hours.

Mix together butter and flour to form a pasty ball.  Remove lid, add horseradish and butter/flour mixture, stirring well.  Cover and continue cooking another 20-30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Taste, and add additional salt and pepper as needed.

Sprinkle with fresh parsley and serve!

### Chef Tips

If your stew gets a lot of fat particles at the top after cooking, either skim it with a spoon or remove beef and veggies to a bowl, then pour liquid through a strainer into the bowl with the beef and veggies.
