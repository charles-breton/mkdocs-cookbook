# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grate 1 teaspoon of zest from the grapefruit, reserving for the salad dressing.
2. Peel the grapefruit by cutting off each end then working your knife around the perimeter. This method removes the membrane from all outside edges. Hold the peeled grapefruit in one hand over a bowl. Use a paring knife and in a sawing motion, cut each segment from the membrane on both sides. Let the juice drip into the bowl and place segments in another bowl.
3. When all segments have been removed from both grapefruit halves, squeeze the remaining juice from the membranes and reserve 1 tablespoon of the juice for the dressing.
4. To prepare the dressing, combine all ingredients except the oil in a bowl. Whisk to combine then slowly drizzle in the oil, whisking constantly until fully emulsified. Set aside.
5. To prepare the salad, place the arugula in a large salad bowl. Toss with about half the dressing. Divide the greens among salad plates; top with grapefruit segments and sliced avocado. Drizzle with the remaining dressing.

## TIPS

The best thing about this recipe is there isn’t any cooking involved. However, I recommend choosing the freshest greens and vegetables for you to truly appreciate the refreshing and palate-cleansing flavors of this recipe.
  
When choosing grapefruit, look for those that are firm but give a bit when pressed – they should not be too spongy. It’s best to keep them at room temperature, if you’re sure to consume them within a week. If you plan to store them longer, keep them in the fridge.
  
Before peeling the grapefruit, wash the skin thoroughly, as any germs on the peel may transfer onto the fleshy part of the fruit. Be careful when peeling the grapefruit, as it can be slippery, especially when the flesh inside becomes exposed. Use a sharp knife so you can peel the thick skin easily.
  
Arugula, also known by the more interesting name “rocket,” is a famous salad green that’s loved for its delightfully pungent leaves and unique appearance. But, remember that older darker leaves have a bit of a peppery taste to them, which is more ideal for soups and other recipes. For salads, it’s best to use the young, paler leaves, which is why I indicate baby arugula in this recipe, due to their milder flavor.
  
Make sure you choose fresh organic arugula with unblemished green leaves that do not have any signs of wilting or yellowing. Store it in a produce bag in the fridge to keep it from wilting. It will last for a week. Tip: if you cannot find baby arugula in your local farmers’ market, you can substitute with spinach, which will taste just as great.
  
Then, there’s avocado. I consider this fruit a real superfood because of its potential to help with weight management, and benefits for your heart and brain. Personally, I eat a whole avocado virtually every day, which I usually put in my salad. This increases my healthy fat and calorie intake without seriously increasing my protein or carbohydrate intake. 

Remember that how you de-skin your avocado can significantly affect how much valuable phytonutrients you get from it. According to research from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), the dark green fruit closest to the inside of the peel has the greatest concentration of beneficial carotenoids. So to preserve the area that holds the most antioxidants, here’s how you should peel an avocado:

Cut the avocado lengthwise, around the seed.

Holding each half, twist in opposite directions. This will cause them to separate from the seed.

Remove the seed and cut each half lengthwise.

Using your thumb and index finger, simply peel the skin off each piece.
