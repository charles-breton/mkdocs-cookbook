Ground almonds not only add flavour to the filling but also help soak up the sweet juices from the apples. Phyllo pastry makes a great and substantially less labour-intensive alternative to strudel pastry. If your apples are especially juicy, there may be extra liquid in the filling that could make the strudel soggy, so scoop the apples from the bowl and leave any juice behind.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In large bowl, combine sliced apples, ground almonds, honey, lemon zest and lemon juice; set aside.
2. Place 1 sheet of phyllo on work surface with short edge closest to you, keeping remainder covered with damp towel to prevent drying out. Brush with butter. Layer with 3 more sheets, brushing each with butter.
3. Spoon half of the apple mixture along short edge, leaving 2-inch (5 cm) border along each long edge; fold in long edges. Starting at filling edge, roll up.
4. Place roll, seam side down, on parchment paper–lined baking sheet; brush with butter. Make 6 diagonal cuts through phyllo top. Repeat to make second roll. _(Make-ahead: Wrap rolls and baking sheet in plastic wrap; refrigerate for up to 6 hours.)_
5. Bake in 350ºF (180ºC) oven until pastry is golden and juices just begin to run, 35 to 38 minutes. Let cool on pan for 10 minutes. To serve, cut each strudel into 6 slices.
