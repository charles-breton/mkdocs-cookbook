### *EXTRA* :


#### **Variations:**

Spinach Artichoke Dip with Fresh Spinach: Cook about 10 ounces of fresh spinach in a skillet with a little drizzle of olive oil. Once the spinach has cooked down, let it cool before squeezing the liquid out of it. I just get a big paper towel, scoop the spinach into it, and gently squeeze it over the sink.

Healthy Spinach Artichoke Dip: Substitute Greek yogurt for sour cream and use low fat cream cheese.

Crockpot Spinach Artichoke Dip: Add everything to the slow cooker and cook on high for 2 hours. Stir well before serving.  

Artichoke Dip without Spinach: use this Artichoke Dip recipe.
