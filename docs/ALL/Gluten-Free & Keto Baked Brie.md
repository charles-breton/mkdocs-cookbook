# INSTRUCTIONS

1. See video for guidance! Whip up a batch of our keto pie crust. 
2. Preheat oven to 350°F/180°C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
3. Roll out pastry dough in between two sheets of parchment paper, lightly dusting with coconut flour as needed. Trim depending on the size of your brie (bake the trimmings into crackers!) 
4. Scatter pecans, garlic powder and thyme in the center of the pie crust. Place brie wheel on top. 
5. Brush edges with egg wash and fold around the wheel, trimming excess dough as needed. If any breakage occurs, just patch it up by pressing the dough together, or adding a trimming if need be. But if the dough becomes unmanageable (i.e. it warms up too much), pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes before carrying on.
6. Place wrapped brie wheel onto prepared baking tray and freeze for at least 10 minutes (or overnight) prior to baking. Brush with egg wash and bake for 27-30 minutes, until golden all over. Be sure to keep an eye out for excessive browning after minute 15-17, as coconut flour can brown too quickly (varying from oven to oven). If needed, place aluminum foil to slow excessive the browning.
7. Allow to rest for 10 minutes before serving, otherwise the melted brie will just ooze right out!

## NOTES

Please note that nutrition facts were calculated using the entire pastry crust (2g net carbs/serving). But you are likely to have leftover scraps, particularly if baking a 5-inch wheel rather than a 7-inch one. So net carbs per serving are more between 1 to 2g per serving.
