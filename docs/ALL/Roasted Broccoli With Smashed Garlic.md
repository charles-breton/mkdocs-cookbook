# INGREDIENTS

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. On the prepared baking sheet, toss the broccoli florets with the garlic, olive oil, salt, and pepper.
3. Spread the broccoli in a single layer and roast in the center of the oven about 15-20 minutes, until broccoli is golden brown and the stems are crisp-tender.
4. Top with Parmesan cheese, if desired.

## NOTES

**Variations:**

- **Vegetables:** Swap broccoli with cauliflower or broccolini.
- **Lemon:** Squeeze a little lemon juice over the roasted broccoli.
- **Heat:** Sprinkle red pepper flakes over the florets for a spicy kick.
- **Spices:** Add other spices, like onion powder, bagel seasoning, dried parsley, thyme, or Italian seasoning
- **Frozen Broccoli:** Many people asked in the comments about using frozen broccoli. I prefer fresh since it’s simple to prep, but if you really want to use frozen, try roasting it for 10 minutes, pull it out of the oven and season it, and then bake for another five to 10 minutes.
- **Feeding more or less people?** Depending on how many people you’re feeding, you can double or halve this roasted broccoli recipe. If you double it, put the florets on 2 baking sheets so they don’t get overcrowded.
