## NOTES

Mix well in a large bowl.  Store container in refrigerator or freezer to help preserve nutrients.  Teff and millet flours are perishable.  You should always refrigerate or freeze unused flours even if it’s not mixed.  I’ve read it can go rancid fast, although I’ve had my mixed bags in the refrigerator for several weeks with no problems.

You’ll notice I don’t add xanthan or guar gum.  This way it can truly be _all purpose_.   You’ll probably need to add some eventually, depending upon its use.
