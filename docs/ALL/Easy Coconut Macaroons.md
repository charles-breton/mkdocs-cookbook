## NOTES

**Shredded Coconut:** You MUST use finely shredded coconut or this will not work.

**Coconut Milk:** if your coconut milk is cold enough that it has separated warm it and whisk it together first

**_Notes on Sweeteners:_** 

_I use my own [blend of xylitol, erythritol, and stevia](https://joyfilledeats.com/sweetener/) in my recipes. This is twice as sweet as sugar. It is comparable to [Trim Healthy Mama Gentle Sweet](https://store.trimhealthymama.com/product/gentle-sweet-xylitol-erythritol-stevia-ground-blend-3lb-bag/?ref=50) and [Truvia](https://amzn.to/2MjGDhY)._

_To sub in [Swerve](https://amzn.to/2MlbUBk) or [Lakanto Monk Fruit](https://amzn.to/2wIYnAW) use 1.5 times the amount of sweetener called for._ 

_To sub in [Pyure](https://amzn.to/2MTpVam) or [Trim Healthy Mama Super Sweet](https://store.trimhealthymama.com/product/super-sweet-blend-erythritol-stevia-3lb-bag/?ref=50) use half the amount of sweetener called for._

_Substitutions will work in most recipes. They may not work in candies, such as caramel._
