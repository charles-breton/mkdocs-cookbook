This trick to this recipe is chilling the can of coconut milk to get a perfectly whipped, vegan whipped cream.

## PREP

###### EQUIPMENT
- Whisk, electric hand mixer, or stand mixer
- Large bowl

# INGREDIENTS

- 1 (about 15-ounce) can : full-fat coconut milk
    
- 1 tablespoon : granulated sugar, or more to taste (optional)
    
- 1 teaspoon : vanilla extract, or more to taste (optional)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place can coconut milk in the refrigerator and leave it there until well-chilled; I left mine in overnight.
    
2. Open the can of coconut milk. There will be a firm, waxy layer on top. Scoop out this firm layer of coconut cream that has solidified at the top of the can into the bowl of a stand mixer or large bowl. Stop as soon as you reach the water at the bottom of the can; don't include anything but the solid cream. (You can use the water in smoothies, or just drink it straight.)
    
3. Whisk or beat on high speed until it becomes fluffy, light, and holds soft peaks, 3 to 5 minutes. Whisk or beat in 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract if desired.
