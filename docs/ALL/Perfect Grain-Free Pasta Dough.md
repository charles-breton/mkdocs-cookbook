# INSTRUCTIONS

1.  In the bowl of a food processor or stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, add the almond flour, tapioca starch, arrowroot starch, and salt, and mix until well combined.
2. In a separate bowl, mix together the eggs, olive oil, and water. With the food processor or mixer running slowly, add the liquids into the dry ingredients. Continue running until the dough is a smooth ball. (Don’t worry—you cannot overwork this dough because it’s gluten-free.)
3. Remove the dough from the bowl, and work in any remaining crumbs. This pasta can be rolled or extruded in a variety of pasta shapes. Use additional tapioca starch as needed to avoid sticking.
4. Basic Homemade Noodles: Divide the dough into 4 equal portions, lightly wrapping unused dough with plastic wrap. Dust your work surface and rolling pin with tapioca starch and roll out the dough as thinly as possible. Cut using a knife or pizza cutter into noodles. Repeat for each portion of dough. (Use a dough scraper to pick up and move noodles.)
5. Cook noodles in plenty of boiling, salted water. Noodles will be done in 3 to 5 minutes, depending on their thickness. I recommend taste testing your noodles for doneness, as opposed to following a set time. Drain cooked noodles and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking.

## NOTES

The pasta dough can be made up to 1 day in advance and kept in the refrigerator wrapped tightly in plastic wrap. Allow the cold dough to warm slightly before working. Avoid making this recipe with an egg substitute.
