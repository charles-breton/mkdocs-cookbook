# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; add the cauliflower and onion in an even layer and let it cook without stirring until it takes on a little color on the bottom, about 2 to 3 minutes.
2. Give it a stir, then add the smoked paprika, salt, black pepper, and water. Cover the skillet and cook until the cauliflower is fork-tender but not mushy, and has taken on a golden color, about 3 to 5 minutes.
3. Turn the heat down to low, add the garlic, and cook 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
4. Stir in the lemon juice and cook until evaporated, about 30 seconds.
5. Serve with the parsley sprinkled on top, and add a fried egg if you like.
