# INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Preheat the oven to 180 Celsius / 356 Fahrenheit.  
2. Mix all dry ingredients in another bowl - coconut flour, psyllium husk powder, xanthan gum and salt. Make sure there are no lumps. 
3. Add the wet ingredients - hot water, yoghurt, melted coconut oil or olive oil - and stir together until a dough forms. 
4. Form a dough ball and let it sit for a few minutes until the coconut flour and the psyllium have absorbed all the moisture and the dough is not sticky.  
5. Cut the dough into 6 pieces and roll them out between two sheets of parchment paper into long flatbreads, about 1/2 cm thick. Place on an upturned baking sheet and remove the top parchment. Optional: sprinkle with sesame seeds and/or nigella seeds. 
6. Bake for 12-15 minutes or until browned (baking time will depend on how thick your flatbreads are). If large air bubbles form, pierce with a fork during baking. If necessary, rotate the baking sheet so the flatbreads brown equally and/or turn on the grill/broiler at the end to ensure they crisp and brown on top.  
7. Top with melted butter, olive oil or coconut oil, sprinkle with more salt and chopped parsley or coriander/cilantro leaves before serving.

## NOTES

One flatbread weighs around 55 grams. 

3.6g net carbs per naan bread.  

They are best served warm - either straight from the oven or toasted.

Some psyllium husk powder brands turn purple when baked. I have used the BonPom, Green Origins and the Just Natural Organics brand here in the UK with good results. A US reader has told me that she uses the Healthworks brand in the US and it does not change colour. However, even if the naan changes colour, this does not affect the taste.

NOTE: It's really essential to add a generous pinch of salt and black and white sesame seeds or, even better, nigella seeds to the bread, and baste it with melted butter, olive or coconut oil before eating. Without, the naan does not have much flavour (as it's mostly coconut flour). It is designed to be eaten WITH a curry.
