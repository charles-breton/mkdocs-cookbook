## NOTES

This cake freezes very well. You just have to thaw or microwave it when you need it.

It stays in the fridge fresh for a week. You just have to warm it or bring it to room temperature just before eating it.
I like to eat this cake warm.

Instead of almond flakes you can use pistachio flakes too.
