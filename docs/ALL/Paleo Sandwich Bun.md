The best **Paleo Hamburger Bun** recipe. This recipe uses almond butter instead of flour to create a light bread like texture. It’s truly unbelievable how good these are! Make a huge batch and freeze them for those weekend BBQ’s.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper. Place 6 wide-mouth mason jar rings or 4 English muffin rings on the baking sheet.
2. Using a stand mixer, mix together all the ingredients except the egg white and sesame seeds.
3. Pour the batter into the 6 mason jar rings, filled to just below the rim, or fill 4 English muffin rings halfway. Brush the egg white over the tops of the buns and sprinkle with the sesame seeds.
4. Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the middle of a bun comes out dry.
5. Allow the buns to cool, then remove them from the molds. Cut off any excess dough that spilled over the molds during baking.
6. Store the buns in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or store in the freezer for up to 3 months.
