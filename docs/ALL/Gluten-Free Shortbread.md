## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 1 1/3 cups white rice flour (5 1/3 ounces; 151 grams)
    
- 1/2 cup sweet rice flour (2.5 ounces/ 70 grams) 
    
- 1/2 cup cornstarch (2 ounces/ 56 grams)
    
- 1 teaspoon salt
    
- 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
    
- 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum this prevents the cookies from spreading
    
- 14 tablespoons butter, softened (7 ounces; 198 grams)
    
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar (5 1/4 ounces; 148 grams)
    
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract


# INSTRUCTIONS


1. Preheat oven to 325°F.
    
2. Combine softened butter, granulated sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer or in a large mixing bowl.
    
    Mix until thick and creamy, about one minute. Use high speed with a handheld mixer and medium-high speed on a stand mixer.
    
    Stop the mixer and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Add the vanilla extract. Mix for an additional minute. Add the gluten-free flour.
    
3. **Stand Mixer directions:** mix for about two minutes on medium-high speed. Be sure to use the flat paddle attachment.
    
    **Stand mixer directions:** Mix on high speed. If the dough seems crumbly after two minutes, stop the mixer. Squeeze the crumbs. If they hold together, press the dough into a ball with your hands or a sturdy rubber spatula. If the dough does not hold together when squeezed, see note below.
    
4. **Shape the Dough.**
    
    **For slice and bake cookies:** divide the dough in half. Dust your counter with gluten-free flour. Knead the. dough a few times until smooth. Then roll out into a log, about 2 inches in diameter. Use a sharp knife and cut into rounds, about ½-inch thick. Place the cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart.
    
    **For cut-out cookies:** Lightly white rice flour your countertop. Turn dough out onto counter and shape dough into a disk. Using a rolling pin, roll dough out, about ½-inch thick.
    
    Cut into shapes. Dip your cutter into gluten-free flour to keep the dough from sticking to the cutter. Place the cookies onto a parchment-lined baking sheet, about 1 inch apart. Gently knead leftover dough into a ball and re-roll. If the dough gets warm, chill it for about 20 minutes.
    
    **For a pan of cookies:** Lightly grease one 9×13-inch pan or two 8-inch round pans. Line with parchment paper. Press dough evenly into the pan. Score into 24 cookies for the 9×13-inch pan and cookies and about 8 triangles each for the 8-inch round pans.
    
5. Poke small holes into the tops of each cookie. Do this for the slice and bake, cutouts, and pan of cookies. You want about three rows of holes per cookie.
    
    Bake until the cookies are set, about 35 minutes. Look for the edges to be lightly golden brown.
    
    Transfer individual cookies to a wire rack. For a pan of cookies, allow the cookies to cool right in the pan.
    
6. Store cookies in an airtight container for up to one week. Or freeze the cooled cookies for up to two months in a freezer container.



## NUTRITIONS



## NOTES

**Gluten-Free Flour.**

Use a gluten-free flour blend that contains xanthan gum. If your blend doesn’t contain xanthan gum, whisk ¼ teaspoon into the flour before using.

**How to Fix Crumbly Dough.** 

If your dough is crumbly and isn’t coming together, here’s how to fix it:

1. Give it a squeeze. If your dough looks crumbly but easily holds together when squeezed, press it into ball with your hands or a sturdy spatula. Some mixers aren’t strong enough
2. Check the temperature. Cold gluten-free shortbread doesn’t come together easily. If your dough feels cold to the touch, let it warm for about 20 minutes and then try mixing again.
3. Add a tiny bit of water. If you’ve checked numbers one and two and the dough still wont’ come together, stop your mixer and add two teaspoons of water. This should help it come together.
    
    **Note:** If after checking the butter temperature and adding water, the dough still won’t come together, I’d check how much flour you added. If you accidentally added too much, the cookie dough will remain too dry.
