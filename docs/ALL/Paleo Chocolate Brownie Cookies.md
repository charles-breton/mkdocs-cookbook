## NOTES

*You can use any kind of dark or unsweetened chocolate here depending on how dark you like your cookies.

**Rolling the dough is a very messy process! I coat my hands in coconut oil before I begin rolling. I use an ice cream scooper or metal spoon to scoop th dough into 1" portions.

***It is imperative that you do not let the dough get warm! If the oven isn’t preheated by the time you have filled a cookie sheet, place it in the refrigerator until the oven is ready.


## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

    •     ¾ cup unsweetened chocolate * chopped

    •     2 TBS coconut oil

    •     1 TBS cocoa butter grated

    •     ¼ cup coconut sugar

    •     ¼ cup pure maple syrup

    •     1 tsp pure vanilla extract

    •     1 egg lightly beaten

    •     ¼ cup almond flour

    •     2 TBS unsweetened cocoa powder

    •     ½ tsp baking powder

    •     ¼ tsp sea salt

    •     1 cup chocolate chips

    •     Extra sea salt for sprinkling optional

# INSTRUCTIONS

Make the dough:

    1    In a saucepan over medium heat, or in a microwave safe bowl, melt unsweetened chocolate, coconut oil and cocoa butter together until smooth.

    2    Once smooth, set aside to cool.

    3    In a small bowl, combine almond flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.

    4    Once the chocolate mixture is cooled (to just over room temperature), add coconut sugar, maple syrup and vanilla and stir to combine.

    5    Add egg and mix until just incorporated.

    6    Add the dry ingredients to your wet mixture and stir until combined {and there are no lumps}.

    7    Fold in cup chocolate chips until evenly distributed.

    8    Place dough in an airtight container and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.

When you are ready to bake the cookies:

    1    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, set aside.

    2    Remove dough from the refrigerator and immediately roll chilled dough into 1-inch balls.**

    3    Place on parchment lined cookie sheets about 2” apart.***

    4    Bake for 9 to 10 minutes until the cookies look just set.

    5    Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.

    6    Eat them warm or store them in an airtight container until you’re ready!


### Ingredient Substitutions

I know it might seem like a splurge to buy higher quality ingredients, but I have found, especially in baking, that it’s _always worth it._ 

- **Unsweetened chocolate.** Use any form of chocolate you’d like, semi-sweet or bitter-sweet chips can be used.
- **Coconut Oil/Cocoa butter.** 3 TBS butter or grass-fed ghee or butter can be used in place of the 2 TBS coconut oil and 1 TBS cocoa butter.
- **Coconut sugar.** Any granulated sugar works well! I have used organic cane sugar.
- **Maple Syrup.** Honey can be used in place of maple syrup/
- **Almond flour.** I don’t recommend changing the type or amount of flour. But all-purpose flour or a gluten-free all-purpose flour blend does work in this recipe.

##### **Paleo chocolate chips/bars**

- [Hu Kitchen Chocolate Gems.](https://amzn.to/3orx98M) This is my favorite paleo chocolate. These gems are delicious and easy to toss into cookies (no bar chopping required).
- [Hu Kitchen Dark Chocolate Bars](https://amzn.to/2RZYZMU). You can also buy dark chocolate bars and chop them up to toss into these paleo chocolate cookies.
- [Lily’s Dark Chocolate](https://amzn.to/3on8i62). They make chips and bars that are stevia sweetened, low carb, keto, etc.
- [Enjoy Life Foods Dark Chocolate Chips](https://amzn.to/2QqLF44) are a good option that are vegan, dairy-free but not fully paleo.

#### Store/freeze

Store baked cookies in an airtight contianer at room temperature for 3 days, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week or in the freezer for 2 months. 

**Freeze the dough**

1. **F**orm dough into balls.
2. Place cookie dough balls on a non-stick cookie sheet and put them in the freezer for 1-2 hours or until firm.
3. Transfer to an airtight, freezer-friendly container (I recommend either a glass storage container or a freezer-friendly ziplock bag).
4. Freeze for up to 1 month.
5. To bake: remove dough from the freezer and let it come to slightly cooler than temperature. Then bake according the the recipe instructions.
