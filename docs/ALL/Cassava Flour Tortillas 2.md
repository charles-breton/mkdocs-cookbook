# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 cup cassava flour
- [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
- [ ] 1/4 tsp baking soda
- [ ] 1/2 tsp cream of tartar
- [ ] 2 tbsp palm shortening, *you could also use avocado oil, olive oil or ghee
- [ ] 2/3 cup warm water, *see notes below

---
# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add the first four dry ingredients to a large bowl and mix together.
2. Add the palm shortening and knead into the dry ingredients for a minute. The mixture will be dry and crumbly
3. Add the warm water and knead together for 2-3 minutes. At first the dough will be sticky, but as the flour absorbs the water it will become dryer and more pliable.
4. When you have a mound of dough, roll it into a log shape in the bowl (like a tube of cookie dough). Then, slice it into 6 pieces. Take each piece and roll into a ball.
5. If you have a tortilla press, take each ball of dough, place it between two pieces of parchment paper and press into a flat tortilla. Without a tortilla press, take each ball of dough between two pieces of parchment paper and roll out into an approximate 6-inch circle.
6. Heat a pan or flat griddle on medium-high heat. As the dry pan heats up, place one tortilla in the pan and cook for approximately one minute. Flip and cook the other side for an additional minute. Continue cooking all tortillas and transfer to a plate with a paper towel.

Eat immediately or freeze in batches for future use.

## TIPS

If you use the palm shortening, proceed with the recipe as is. If you use a more liquid oil/fat, reduce the water by just a smidge (about 1-2 tablespoons). If you forget to do this and your dough is sticky, you can always add 1-2 tablespoons of cassava flour to thicken it back up.

The dough should have the texture of soft playdough. If it's too sticky, add more cassava flour. If it's too dry and crumbly, add more water. You can see the perfect texture in the video above.

This is my favorite tortillas press and I've used it for years.

I find it's easiest to cook the tortillas in an enameled cast iron or ceramic non-stick pan.

To freeze the cassava flour tortillas, place them in a single layer in the freezer. Once frozen, you can stack them with parchment paper in between and place them in a food storage container in the freezer. Watch my meal prep containers video to see my favorite containers.
