It's our new go-to special-occasion cake: a tall, tender beauty that's sophisticated yet easy to make. What saves the lush milk [[Chocolate Frosting]] from being cloying is the addition of tangy sour cream.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 (325 Berkley?) degrees. Butter two 8-inch round cake pans, and line with parchment. Butter paper, and flour pans. Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.
2. Beat together butter and sugars with a mixer until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in yolk and [eggs](http://www.marthastewart.com/dap/term/1002?lc=int_mb_1001), 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Beat in [vanilla](http://www.marthastewart.com/dap/term/1310?lc=int_mb_1001). Gradually add flour mixture to butter mixture in 3 additions, alternating with sour cream and milk, beginning and ending with flour. Fold in chocolate.
3. Divide batter between pans, and spread evenly with an offset spatula. Bake until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted in centers comes out clean, about 40 (35 Berkley?) minutes. Let cakes cool in pans 20 minutes. Invert cakes, remove pans and parchment, and let cool completely, right side up, on wire racks.
4. Cut each cake in half horizontally with a serrated knife. Place 1 bottom layer on a platter or cake stand, and spread evenly with 3/4 cup frosting. Repeat with a second layer and another 3/4 cup frosting. Place third layer on top, and spread with another 3/4 cup frosting. Place fourth layer on top. Spread entire cake with remaining frosting (about 2 3/4 cups), smoothing top and sides. Serve immediately, or refrigerate, uncovered, up to 2 days; if refrigerated, let cake come to room temperature before serving.
