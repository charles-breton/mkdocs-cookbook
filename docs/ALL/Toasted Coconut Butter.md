# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 2 cupsÂ or moreÂ **unsweetened, flaked coconut**
- [ ] **Coconut sugar,**Â _optional, to taste_
- [ ] **Sea salt**,Â _optional, to taste_

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Toast the coconut in the preheated oven for 5-7 minutes, or until lightly golden brown. Let cool for about 10 minutes.
2. Add the coconut into aÂ [food processor](https://amzn.to/3AlpY8O)Â or high-powered blender (like aÂ [Vitamix](https://www.amazon.com/Vitamix-Explorian-Professional-Grade-Low-Profile-Container/dp/B07CX95VRT?crid=L8ZUJ3QPWDAO&keywords=vitamix+explorian+blender&qid=1663007436&sprefix=vitamix+ex%2Caps%2C143&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&linkCode=li2&tag=bakerita0c-20&linkId=2f1279de32a24eff934adc169d1c1b5a&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_il)). Turn it up to high speed and let the mixture process for 5-7 minutes, scraping down as necessary, until it turns into a thin, liquidy texture. Salt and add sweetener to taste, and transfer into a small jar. Coconut butter will harden as it cools down.
3. Store at room temperature for up to 2 months, or in the refrigerator indefinitely.

## NOTES

I would recommend starting with at least 2 cups of unsweetened flaked coconut,

TheyÂ _must_Â be unsweetened, or it wonâ€™t work, and Iâ€™ve only had success with the flakes of coconut (I usedÂ [this brand](http://www.iherb.com/Edward-Sons-Organic-Coconut-Flakes-Unsweetened-7-oz-200-g/32715?gclid=CjgKEAjw2pSdBRCc5Or_vuWw7TgSJAA5txZgV4aAmoZ3Sg4WYtl02XzqIM4XsagHjpI1D3fDQgR0j_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)Â but Bobâ€™s Red Mill also makes them) so I canâ€™t guarantee how a more shredded texture would go.

_possible to use part toasted coconut and part untoasted coconut, if you want the toasty flavor to be a little more subtle. ðŸ˜ƒadd a little bit of flaked sea salt
