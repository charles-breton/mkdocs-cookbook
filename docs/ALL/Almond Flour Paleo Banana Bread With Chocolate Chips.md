# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 2 cups super fine **[almond flour](http://amzn.to/2DdmJB5)** _(made from blanched almonds, not almond meal)_
- [ ] 1/4 cup **[tapioca flour](http://amzn.to/2rfI1wh)**
- [ ] 1 teaspoon **baking soda**
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon **fine sea salt**
- [ ] 3 small **extra ripe bananas**, equal to 1 cup well mashed.

- [ ] 2 **large eggs**
- [ ] 2 tablespoons **[avocado oil](http://amzn.to/2yaPHlD)** (or light olive oil)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon **[vanilla extract](http://amzn.to/2xZISmb)**

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Preheat oven** to 350ºF and line a [8×4 medium loaf pan](http://amzn.to/2wYHrFr) with parchment paper; set aside.
2. **Mix dry ingredients:** In medium bowl add almond flour, tapioca flour, baking soda and salt.
3. **Whisk wet ingredients:** In large bowl whisk together mashed banana and sugar (if using). Then whisk in eggs, oil and vanilla extract until smooth.
4. **Combine:** Pour dry ingredients into large bowl of wet ingredients, using spatula to stir. Then fold in chocolate chips.
5. **Bake:** Pour batter into prepared loaf pan, topping with more chocolate chips and chocolate chunks. Bake banana bread for 20 minutes uncovered, then add foil for the last 15-20 minutes of baking to prevent the top from browning too quickly. My bread took roughly 40 minutes but check the middle for done-ness with toothpick after 35 minutes just to be sure.
6. **Cool & serve:** Allow bread to cool in pan for 15 minutes before lifting from the parchment paper to remove bread. Slice into 10 slices and ENJOY!

## NOTES

*Option to omit sugar for less sweet bread. I suggest using super ripe bananas if leaving out granulated sweetener. Use coconut sugar for paleo or dry granulated sweetener of choice I did not test this recipe with other flours, see links in post for suggestions.

**Tapioca Flour** – if you don’t have tapioca flour, use 2.5 tablespoons coconut flour in its place. You can also use 1/4 cup arrowroot powder or 3 tablespoons of 1:1 gluten free baking flour if not strictly grain-free.

**Bananas** – if using frozen/thawed bananas, it is best to remove some of the excess liquid you get. I believe that is what is causing some issues with bake time from some readers.
