# INSTRUCTIONS

1. For the Basil-Mayo: combine ingredients in a small food processor then process until smooth. Alternatively, mince basil and garlic then whisk all ingredients together. Can be done a couple days a head of time.
2. Lay out two large lettuce leaves then layer on 1 slice of turkey and slather with Basil-Mayo. Layer on a second slice of turkey followed by the bacon, and a few slices of both avocado and tomato. Season lightly with salt and pepper then fold the bottom up, the sides in, and roll like a burrito. Slice in half then serve cold
