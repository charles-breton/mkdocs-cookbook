# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. Rinse and pat dry salmon. Place on baking sheet and brush coconut oil on both sides. Place skin side down and sprinkle the [paprika](https://articles.mercola.com/herbs-spices/paprika.aspx) and Old Bay seasoning on top. Grind a few good turns of black pepper and sprinkle a scant amount of gray salt.
3. Bake for 12 minutes. Remove from oven and cover with foil. Let stand for about 5 to 10 minutes. The salmon will continue to cook while resting. Cut into 4 pieces and serve.

## NOTES

 If Old Bay Seasoning is not available, another seafood seasoning would be fine, or a combination of celery salt, dried mustard, black pepper and a small amount of the following: ground bay leaves, ground cloves, allspice, ginger, mace, cardamom, cinnamon and paprika.
