# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees and prepare a 9 x 5 loaf pan by either oiling the dish or lining with parchment paper. (I'm a big fan of the parchment paper for easy removal from pan and easy clean up.)
2. In a medium bowl, whisk together baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg and flours. In a separate small bowl, mix together coconut oil, eggs, bananas, maple syrup and vanilla until very well combined.
3. Add wet ingredients to the dry and gently mix together until combined. Do not overmix.
4. Pour batter in prepared pan and bake for 45-55 minutes or until set in the center and a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool in pan for about 15-20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely

## NOTES

This recipe converts well to muffins. Divide batter between 12 muffin tins and reduce baking time to 18-22 minutes.
