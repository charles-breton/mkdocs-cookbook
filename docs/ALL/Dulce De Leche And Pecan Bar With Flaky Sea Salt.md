###### *RELATED* : 

This buttery bar is inspired by the iconic butter tart but replaces all-purpose flour with gluten-free PC® Organics Fine Grind Almond Flour and swaps out the traditional maple-brown sugar filling for PC® Dulce de Leche, a sweet Latin American spread. Don’t you love when worlds collide?

## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 1 1/2 cups (375 mL)
    
    PC®Organics Fine Grind Almond Flour
    
- 1/3 cup (83 mL)
    
    granulated sugar
    
- 1/3 cup (83 mL)
    
    corn starch
    
- 6 tbsp (90 mL)
    
    salted butter, melted and cooled
    
- 1 1/4 cups (31 mL)
    
    raw pecan halves, roughly chopped
    
- 1/2 cup + 2 tbsp (125 ml + 30 ml )
    
    PC®Dulce de Leche Caramel Crème Spread, divided
    
- 1/4 cup (1 mL)
    
    flaky sea salt, for garnish


# INSTRUCTIONS

- Step 1 : Preheat oven to 350⁰F. Line 8-inch square metal baking dish with 2 overlapping sheets of parchment paper, leaving a 2-inch overhang on each side.
- Step 2 : Whisk together almond flour, sugar and corn starch in medium bowl. Add melted butter and mix with rubber spatula until a crumbly dough forms. Press dough evenly into bottom of prepared pan using spatula or hands.
- Step 3 : Bake until lightly golden, 13 to 15 minutes. Set aside.
- Step 4 : Meanwhile, stir together pecans and 1/2 cup dulce de leche in medium bowl. Us-ing rubber spatula, evenly spread dulce de leche and pecan mixture over base un-til completely covered, spreading all the way into edges and corners
- Step 5 : Bake until nuts are toasted and dulce de leche is deep brown, about 9 minutes. Transfer to rack and cool 30 minutes. Using parchment, lift bars out of pan onto cutting board. Cut into 16 squares.
- Step 6 : Heat remaining 2 tbsp dulce de leche in microwave-safe bowl to loosen, 10 to 15 seconds. Drizzle warm dulce de leche on top of bars. Sprinkle with flaky sea salt.
