## NOTES

1. Baking time really will vary by pan size, if you are making sheet cake, thinner layer cakes, or cupcakes with this batter.
2. I have tested this recipe with King Arthur Measure for Measure GF, Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 GF blend, and Authentic Foods Multi Blend. That doesn't mean others will not work, I just have not tested other flours.
3. If your gluten free flour blend doesn’t contain Xanthan Gum or Guar Gum, please add 1 teaspoon.
4. To make this recipe dairy-free, substitute the butter for vegan butter.
5. There are several great gluten free cocoa powder brands I like to use. Ghirardelli, Rhodelle, Anthony's, and Hershey.
6. This cake will keep up to 4 days in an air-tight container, or up to 4 months in the freezer.

### SPECIAL NOTE

Please know that every gluten free flour blend has a different starch to grain ratio. If you use a blend I didn't test, you may need to adjust your moisture levels in your baked goods.
