# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Put 1 1/2 cup milk in a jar, to that same jar, add all of the other ingredients including the liquor if used. Mix Well.
2. Heat the remaining milk in a pot and then add the content of the jar. Whisk until thickened. Cool and then add the softened butter.
3. Margaret added some cocoa to about half of the filling. 
4. In a 20 x 30 cm pyrex, put a layer of cookies at the bottom, and add about 1/4 of the filling. Repeat until you have 4 layers, the top filling layer could be a little less thick than the other ones. We can alternate the cocoa filling and the vanilla one if we want. Add the coconut on top.
