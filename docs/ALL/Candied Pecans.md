# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine all ingredients except the pecans in a skillet and cook over medium heat for a minute or two, until the sugar dissolves and the mixture is bubbling.
2. Add the pecans and cook for an additional 3 minutes, stirring to coat the pecans in the glaze.
3. Remove from the heat, and spread the pecans out on parchment paper to let the pecans cool completely.
4. Break apart, and enjoy!

## NOTES

**Storage:** These can be stored in an airtight jar for about one week.

**Freezing:** Store in an airtight container for up to 2 months.

**If the nuts are sticky:** If the pecans turn out sticky, this means the sugar never reached a high enough temperature to have that hard crack “brittle” coating on the outside. Electric stoves tend to have less heat power and responsiveness as compared to gas stoves, so cook for a few minutes longer if you have an electric stove or a weaker gas stove. Just watch and smell to ensure it doesn’t burn.
