# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a mini muffin tin with baking spray (optional)
2. Use a food processor to process 1 cup of the oats until consistency is like flour. Pour into a medium size bowl. Add the remaining cup of oats and the quinoa. Stir to combine.
3. No need to clean the food processor. Add the apricots, dried cherries, dates, and raisins. Pulse to break down the fruits into tiny pieces. Going all the way to a smooth paste is fine too. Add the oats and quinoa and back into the food processor.
4. Add the honey, coconut flakes, pistachios, melted butter, and baking soda. Pulse until the mixture comes together. It will likely form a ball.
5. Place about 1 tablespoon of the mixture into each mini muffin space. Press down to fill the muffin cavity.
6. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the edges start to brown.
7. Let cool in the muffin tin completely before removing.
