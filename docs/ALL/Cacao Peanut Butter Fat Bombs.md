# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In the bowl of a food processor or high-powered blender, combine all of the ingredients. Pulse for 1-2 minutes, until the peanuts start to break down and everything starts to break down. It will first become powdery and will stick together slightly, but still be crumbly.
    
2. Keep processing until the oils start to release a bit and the mixture sticks together easily - just be careful not to over process or you’ll have nut butter. If your mixture seems dry and if you're not using the date, you may need the extra tablespoon of peanut butter to help it come together. Once the mixture is sticking together well, pulse in the cacao nibs, just to incorporate them.
    
3. Use a small cookie scoop (I use this one) or a tablespoon scoop to divide the mixture into equal pieces. Use your hands to roll into balls and place on a plate or baking sheet and place in the fridge to firm up for about 30 minutes.
    
4. Store in an airtight container zip-top bag in the refrigerator or freezer.
