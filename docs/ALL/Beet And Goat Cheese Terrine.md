_THESE RIDICULOUSLY good-looking sisters have made a ridiculously good-looking cookbook we’re ready to display with our collection of art books. With a school bus yellow-colored hardcover the size of an old school textbook, [The Art of Eating Well](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576877272/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1576877272&linkCode=as2&tag=thechamag-20&linkId=7CWWHM3PNJUN3LUD) is perfect for styling up any fall coffee table. A cookbook for the coffee table? Why not! It’s gorgeous, interesting, and may just get you up from your OITNB marathon long enough for a healthy home-cooked dinner._

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 4 purple beets, about 10 ½ oz

- [ ] 2 Tbsp freshly snipped chives

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line a 4 x 8 inch loaf tin with parchment paper, leaving enough paper hanging over that you can easily cover the terrine when the tin is full.
2. Scrub the beet, then place in a pan, cover with water, pop on the lid, and cook for about 30–40 minutes until tender. Set aside to cool, then peel.
3. Meanwhile, mix all the herbs and garlic with the goats’ cheese in a bowl and season to taste.
4. Slice the cooked beets into various thicknesses – some 1⁄8 inch, some 1⁄4 inch.
5. Put a layer of golden or candy-colored beets along the bottom of the tin, followed by a thin layer of the garlic and herb goats’ cheese mix. Do this for 6 layers of each, so you have 12 layers in total, and then start on the purple beets and cheese layers until you reach the top. If you have more colors, vary them as you go along.
6. Pull the parchment paper over so all the terrine is covered. Place a weight on top of the tin and leave in the fridge overnight or for 8 hours to set.
7. Cover the set terrine with a plate and turn upside down to remove the terrine. Slice and serve or refrigerate the terrine until needed.
