## The Hearty Benefits of Homemade Bone Broth

Consumed by various cultures for thousands of years, bone broth has been highly valued for its curative properties since early times. It is actually one of the foods I highly recommend and ingest regularly to help maintain my well-being. I’m actually glad to see this health food in the spotlight, perhaps owing to endorsements of it by professional athletes like LeBron James and Kobe Bryant,1 as well as its popularity in trendy restaurants in locations like New York and Los Angeles that are dedicated to serving bone broth.2,3,4

But what exactly is bone broth? In its simplest form, this is a concoction made by simmering bones or carcasses of animals in water, in a pot or slow cooker, for a certain period of time.

Take note that the simmering time, which can take anywhere from an hour to 72 hours, is important. The longer you allow the broth to simmer, the more gelatin, minerals and nutrients — such as phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, potassium and trace minerals — are released from the bones. These components are what give the broth its restorative and healing properties. According to registered dietitian and My Foodie Noodie founder Kayla McDonell, here are some ways that bone broth can improve well-being:5

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Benefits your digestive system|Delivers many important vitamins and minerals|Improves sleep and brain function|
|Supports joint health|Promotes weight loss|Fights inflammation|

Bone broth is a crucial key to healing and sealing your gut, and helps promote healthy digestion as well. It can help reduce joint pain and inflammation thanks to the cartilage, which expels generous amounts of chondroitin sulfates, [glucosamine](https://articles.mercola.com/vitamins-supplements/glucosamine.aspx) and other compounds. There’s no one way to create a delicious pot of bone broth, but here are some helpful tips you should keep in mind:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Identify a source for high-quality animal bones.** They should come from grass fed animals, and not from livestock raised in [concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs)](https://www.mercola.com/infographics/truth-about-factory-farms.htm).|**Use a slow cooker or crockpot for more efficient and hassle-free cooking.** You can put the ingredients in the pot in the morning, turn it on low heat and then come back to it in the evening.|
|**The more gelatinous your broth, the more nourishing it is.** This is because it contains high amounts of collagen. If your broth becomes jiggly after being placed in the fridge, then it’s a sign that it’s well made.|**Use a mixture of bones**. You can use beef, chicken, pork and even fish bones.<br><br>For more collagen and cartilage, try adding pig feet, chicken feet or joint bones to the broth. Meanwhile, shank or leg bones can give you plenty of bone marrow, which also provides valuable health benefits.|
|**Use filtered water to make your broth.**|**Add a small amount of** [**apple cider vinegar (ACV)**](https://articles.mercola.com/apple-cider-vinegar-benefits-uses.aspx) **to the broth during the cooking process.** ACV will help leach the minerals out of the bones.|
|**Freeze your broth for later use.**||

## These Two Spices Add a Depth of Flavor to Your Broth

While vegetables and spices are only a secondary requirement to making bone broth, I have to admit that they play an essential role in making sure you end up with a nourishing soup that you will enjoy sipping. In this recipe, the ginger and turmeric add an Asian-like vibe to the broth. But aside from the flavor, these ingredients can provide you with wholesome benefits.

Turmeric, a spice that’s been used in Ayurvedic and Chinese medicine for many years now, has garnered a great deal of interest due to its healing properties. Case in point: Turmeric milk, or “golden milk, is now a fast-rising trend. Aside from curcumin, its active component, turmeric contains high amounts of fiber, iron, manganese, magnesium, potassium and vitamins B6 and C, all of which can contribute to health benefits, such as:

- Helping ease inflammation that can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases and other illnesses
- Provides relief for joint pain and [rheumatoid arthritis symptoms](https://articles.mercola.com/rheumatoid-arthritis/symptoms.aspx)
- Helps manage [cholesterol levels](https://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/08/10/making-sense-of-your-cholesterol-numbers.aspx)
- Relieves indigestion
- Offers heart- and liver-protective effects

Similar to turmeric — and in fact, its close cousin — ginger is also an ancient spice that has played a role in food and medicine for centuries. Just recently, it has been found to have an effect on metabolic syndrome, a condition that is closely related to [obesity](https://articles.mercola.com/obesity.aspx), as well as diseases like Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular problems.6

Other health effects attributed to ginger include its ability to reduce oxidative stress, provide relief for nausea and help ease pain and discomfort.
