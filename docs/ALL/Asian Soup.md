# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Put the water in a pot and start to heat, add the fish sauce, vinegar, oil, ginger and miso. Bring to boil and cook for a few minutes. Add the veggies longer to cook such as carrots, mushrooms, cabbage, red onions, (celery and pepper) and cook for a couple of minutes. Add the uncooked shrimps (or meat) and the vermicelli and cook for about one more minute before adding the rest of the veggies except the green onions, (fresh coriander, bean sprouts) and cook for like another minute or two. Add some soy sauce and taste the broth if tasty enough. Put in bowls and add to taste green onions, (fresh coriander, bean sprouts) to taste. Enjoy!
