# INSTRUCTIONS

- [ ]     1    Mix fat-reduced almond flour, almond flour, sweetener, baking powder, xanthan gum and salt in a small bowl. Set aside. 

    2    Whisk thoroughly together in a medium bowl the eggs, butter and vanilla extract. Whisk in the dry ingredients followed by the milk, a tablespoon at a time. You can play with the thickness a bit, but I found the best consistency to be with 4 TBSP (the batter is thicker than with regular pancakes, but will spread easily into a round). Allow the batter to rest for 10 minutes while you heat up a skillet or pan. 

    3    Add a little butter to the pan, pour in about 1/4 cup of batter, spreading it slightly to help it form a nice round (you can use a wet spoon or spatula). Cook over medium heat until the top begins to darken, flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more. Serve right away with toppings of choice.

## NOTES

*With this recipe I’m introducing a new flour for you guys: fat-reduced almond flour! I originally recommended Sukrin, but you guys have had them sold out for months… and so thanks to you I tried Barney’s Butter Powder Almond Butter, which is in essence the same thing!

Want more deets?! Read up on it in 'The Flours' section of the post. 

**For the ‘milk’ you can do almond (or any nut) milk, half heavy cream half water, or even add some sour cream for a ‘buttermilk’ kick.
