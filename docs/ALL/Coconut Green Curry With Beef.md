This coconut green curry is savory and creamy. Plus, it is high in vitamin B12, protein, iron, vitamin C and zinc.

## PREP



# INGREDIENTS

1 lb of Skirt steak (also good with ground beef)

1 cup of Sugar snap peas or green beans (We like a lot the long Asian beans, you can buy them in the Asian produce section at the Superstore and when I use an entire bag (about 1 lb) for this recipe

1 cup of Broccoli florets (I put 1 whole Broccoli)

1 cup of Green pepper, chopped ( or other pepper)

1/2 cup of Onion, chopped ( I put 1-2 big onions)

Mushrooms (optional but very good)

1 cup of Coconut milk ( I use an entire 400 ml can) ou même 1 L

1 cup of stock [ne pas en mettre et à la place mettre cette quantité d'eau dans la boîte de lait de coco une fois vide et ajouter à la recette]

1 1/2 tsp of Green curry paste

1 clove of Garlic

2 tbsps of Basil, fresh, chopped (I use dry basil about the same quantity)

2 tbsp of coconut oil

salt to taste (always Himalayan or sea salt)


# INSTRUCTIONS


1. In a skillet on medium high, add the coconut oil and steak strips ( or ground beef). Cook until steak is browned (1 - 2 minutes). Set steak aside. 

2. Add onions, vegetables, and garlic to skillet and cook for 2 - 3 min, stirring constantly. Turn heat down to medium low, and add coconut milk, beef stock, green curry paste and basil to vegetables. Cover and cook for 8 min. 

3. Return beef to pan, uncover, and cook for another 5 min or until beef is cooked all the way through.
