A sugar free and low carb life does not mean missing out on great tasting food such as these Low Carb Scones. I just want to clarify that this scone recipe is to make scones that go with jam and cream, otherwise known as Devonshire tea.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 180 C/350 F Fan Forced
2. Mix dry ingredients together till well blended, ensuring baking powder and soda are well mixed.
3. Add remaining ingredients and mix gently till combined.
4. Important- Leave sit for 10 mins to enable dough to thicken slightly.
5. Shape gently with hands on baking paper so that it the dough is about 3-4 cms/1.5 " thick. Using a small scone cutter (or champagne glass) cut into 12 scones. Scoop the dough gently back together, to cut the last few scones
6. Bake at 180 C/350 C fan forced for about 12-14 minutes or till cooked.
7. You can brush the tops of the scones with butter or egg just prior to baking to brown slightly but it isn't necessary.

## NOTES

- Note that I don't add sweetener to this recipe because I always serve them with jam and cream. You could add a tiny amount if you wished to and some vanilla extract, but keep it to a minimum.
    
- Always minimize your handling of the dough so keep them as light as possible.
    
- Cut cooked scones in half with a really sharp serrated knife to serve, as they don't have any gluten in them they are a bit more fragile than normal scones.
    
- If you wish to reheat or freshen scones, zap in the microwave for a few seconds or heat in a low to moderate oven for about 5 minutes.
