# INGREDIENTS

- [ ]  2 tablespoons Whole Psyllium Husk
- [ ] 1/2 cup Coconut Flour fine, fresh, no lumps
- [ ] 1 cup Lukewarm water
- [ ] 1 tablespoon Extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoons Baking soda
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoons salt - optional

#### COOKING

- [ ]  1 teaspoon Extra virgin olive oil

---
# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a medium mixing bowl, combine the psyllium husk and coconut flour (if lumps are in your flour, use a fork to smash them BEFORE measuring the flour, the amount must be precise). 
2. Add in the lukewarm water (I used tap water about 40°C/100°F bath temperature), olive oil, and baking soda. Give a good stir with a spatula, then use your hands to knead the dough. Add salt now if you want. I never add the salt in contact with baking soda to avoid deactivating the leavening agent.
3. Knead for 1 minute. The dough is moist, and it gets softer and slightly dryer as you go. It should come together easily to form a dough, as in my picture. If it is too sticky, add more husk, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, knead for 30 sec and see how it goes. The dough will always be a bit moist, but it shouldn't stick to your hands at all. It must come together as a dough. 
4. Set aside 10 minute in the mixing bowl. 
5. Now the dough must be soft, elastic, and hold well together. It's ready to roll. 

#### ROLL AND SHAPE THE FLATBREAD

- [ ] Cut the dough into 6 even pieces, roll each piece into a small ball. 
- [ ] Place one of the dough balls between two parchment paper pieces, press the ball with the palm of your hands to stick it to the paper, and start rolling with a rolling pin as thin as you like your bread. My bread dough is 8 inches in diameter, and I made 6 keto flatbreads with this recipe. 
- [ ] Unpeel the first layer of parchment paper from your flatbread. Use a lid to cut out round flatbread. Keep the outside dough to reform a ball and roll more flatbread - that is how I make 2 extra flatbread from the 4 balls above! 

#### COOK IN NON STICK PAN

- [ ] Warm a non-stick Tefal crepe or pancake pan under medium/high heat- or use any non-stick pan of your choice, the one you would use for your pancakes.  
- [ ] Add one teaspoon of olive oil or vegetable oil of your choice onto a piece of absorbent paper. Rub the surface of the pan to make sure it is lightly oiled. Don't leave any drops of oil, or the bread will fry!  
- [ ] Flip over the flatbread on the hot pan and peel off carefully the last piece of parchment paper.   
- [ ] Cook for 2-3 minutes on the first side, flip over using a spatula and cook for 1-2 more minutes on the other side.  
- [ ] Cool the flatbread down on a plate and use as a sandwich wrap later or enjoy hot as a side dish. I recommend a drizzle of olive oil, crushed garlic, and herbs before serving! (optional but delish!)
- [ ] Repeat the rolling, cooking for the next 3 keto flatbread. Make sure you rub the oiled absorbent paper onto the saucepan each time to avoid the bread to stick to the pan. 
- [ ] Store in the pantry in an airtight box or on a plate covered with plastic wrap to keep them soft for up to 3 days. 
- [ ] Rewarm in the same pan, or if you want to give them a little crisp, rewarm in the hot oven on a baking sheet for 1-2 minutes at 300F/150C.

## NOTES

Psyllium husk: don't use Metamucil fiber supplement in this recipe, this is not the same product as whole psyllium husk fiber. Metamucil is a husk powder that is not suitable for baking keto bread. It will turn the bread dry, purple, or blue.

Recipe size: I made 6 flatbreads with this recipe - I reused the border of the 4 flatbread cut into a round shape to reform 2 extra flatbreads. Feel free to double up the recipe to make more flatbread! 

Storage: Store in the pantry for up to 3 days onto a plate covered with plastic wrap to keep them soft or in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Rewarm tips: they are softer when cold and stored for a few days. I rewarm mine in the pan or a hot oven or make a sandwich wrap in a toaster press.

Freeze: you can freeze them as you will freeze regular flatbread. Rewarm in the oven or in a sandwich toaster to give them a little crisp

Net carbs are carbs minus fiber, 2.6 grams of net carbs per flatbread in this recipe
