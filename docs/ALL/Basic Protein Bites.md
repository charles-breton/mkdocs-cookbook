# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 2 Scoops Vanilla [Whey Protein Powder](https://web.archive.org/web/20180110223328/http://tryabouttime.com/shop/2lb-whey-protein-isolate/)
- [ ] 1/2 cup nut butter

- [ ] 1 cup oats
- [ ] extras as desired (chia seeds, etc.)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix together your dry ingredients first. In a separate bowl, combine nut butter and sticky sweetener (if desired, microwave for about 8 seconds for easier mixing). Add sticky ingredients to dry ingredients and mix together. Add your extras if desired. Roll into balls and chill before eating! Enjoy!

## NOTES

_These bites can stay about a week in the fridge, but usually they don’t last that long.  Each recipe is slightly different, and you’ll want to experiment with the ratio of dry ingredients to wet, to find the right consistency for your favorite bites. If you use fewer sticky ingredients, you can always add a bit of almond milk to help make the ingredients easier to stir._
