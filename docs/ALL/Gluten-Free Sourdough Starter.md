# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Gluten-free Sourdough Starter

- Combine 1/2 cup flour (whatever gluten-free flour or [gluten-free flour blend](https://www.amazon.com/Namaste-Foods-Gluten-Perfect-Resealable/dp/B00HGIQJV8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?keywords=gluten+free+flour+blend&qid=1585692003&sr=8-2&linkCode=ll1&tag=whnemo-20&linkId=1a3372b37cc5f7f75f668e56b616106c&language=en_US) you like) and a scant 1/2 cup filtered water in a medium to large bowl.
    
    Whisk until smooth and cover the gluten free sourdough starter with a cheesecloth or clean dishtowel to allow air to circulate but prevent particles from falling in.
    
    Set the bowl in a warm area where it will not be disturbed. A kitchen counter, pantry cabinet, or patio can all be good options.
    
- Wait 12-24 hours.
    
- At least twice a day for the next six days, at regular intervals, add 1/2 cup of flour and a scant 1/2 cup of filtered water to the existing starter.  Mix until smooth, and cover.
    
    This is called feeding the starter.
    
    Make sure to watch your starter carefully.
    
- When your gluten-free sourdough starter is very bubbly and creates a dome on top 2-3 hours after each feeding (like the above picture), you are ready to make bread. This is often called the sponge and typically it takes 5-7 days for this to happen.
    
- Use your starter for making the sourdough bread of choice. See above this recipe card in the post for some great options!
    

#### For Coconut Flour Starter

- Combine 1/8 cup coconut flour[](https://cocotreasure.com/shop/organic-coconut-flour/) with 1/2 cup filtered water in a large bowl. Whisk until smooth. The mixture should be pourable but not thin.
    
- Cover the bowl with a plate or other air tight cover, making sure there’s at least a 1/2-inch gap of air at the top.
    
- Approximately every 12 hours add another 1/8 cup of coconut flour and ½ cup purified water. Stir well and cover.
    
- In 24–48 hours the mixture should get bubbly and smell fermented. If no bubbles form, try increasing the frequency of feedings to every 8-10 hours.
    
- If at any time there isn't a 1/2 inch gap at the top of the starter, move it to a larger bowl.
