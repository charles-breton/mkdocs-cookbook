# INSTRUCTIONS

1. To prepare the squash: peel, deseed and cut into 1/2-inch cubes; toss with melted coconut oil, salt, pepper and herbs. Bake for 25-30 minutes at 375 degrees, or until each piece is tender all the way through (test one with a fork).  
2. Cut the broccoli into bite size pieces and steam for 7-8 minutes or until vibrantly green and slightly tender.  
3. To make the sauce: blend everything together until smooth, adding as much or as little water as you like.  
4. Place butternut squash and broccoli on a plate or in a bowl, drizzle with your sauce, then sprinkle on green onion and sesame seeds.
