[**Cauliflower Rice (moyen) Meilleur de couper du chou-fleur en fleurettes au lieu de le couper en riz**]

---
# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 head cauliflower, chopped
- [ ] 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- [ ] Sea salt and black pepper to taste

---
# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the chopped cauliflower florets into a food processor and pulse until the cauliflower has reduced into tiny pieces – the same size as grains of rice (or chop by hand with a sharp knife).
    
2. In a frying pan, heat the coconut oil over medium heat and lightly cook the cauliflower for about 4 to 6 minutes, or until softened. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
    
3. Serve it where you would normally have rice - so much healthier for you and what I love is that it take a quarter of the time to cook!
    
4. You can add garlic, chilli, other spices, seeds, nuts, herbs, meats, seafoods, vegetables, sauces, etc.
