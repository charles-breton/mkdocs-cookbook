# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Prepare your flax eggs -- mix 3 Tbsp flax with 9 Tbsp warm water. Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes. 
3. Combine crust ingredients. Bake for 12 minutes, then take out of oven until pie filling is ready.
4. In a medium saucepan, combine ingredients (butter through cornstarch) over low heat, stirring frequently. It will thicken up over 10 minutes or so while the crust is pre-baking.
5. Cook your butternut squash -- I microwaved mine covered with 1/2 cup of water for 4 minutes on High. Then, drain the water...and add in the almond milk. Use an immersion stick blender to puree. 
6. Add butternut squash/almond milk mixture to the syrup-y mixture on the stovetop as well as the flax eggs made in step 2. Then, stir in pecans.
7. Pour into the partially-baked pie crust, and then bake entire pie for 60 minutes. 
8. Let cool for an hour before slicing.

## NOTES

*You can always bake this in a regular pie crust -- and just follow the instructions for the filling for the pecan pie. Up to you!
