I use peppers of any colour you have. I try to have colourful variety.  As for tomatoes any are good as long as they are hard if too juicy I cut out the centre.  Cucumber is a must plus onion, it can be green.  I usually use red leaf lettuce sometimes no lettuce if none in the fridge.  

Shredded cheese sometimes I sprinkle with feta.  

As to meat 

I fry garlic before adding meat,

  

I add chilli (sauce I think)), red paprika, some tomatoe paste sometimes ketchup plus a hint of some hot sauce and a bit of taco seasoning.  *See taco seasoning recipe below

  

 I mix peppers and cucumbers with salt, black pepper,oregano and tomatoes with onion - tastes better and easier to do layers. (Start with some meat and cheese, then lettuce and then veggies, repeat. Finish with cheese on top and create a crown with some chips on the side of the bowl.  (Broil) a few

mins.(2-3)
