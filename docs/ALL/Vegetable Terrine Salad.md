# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line each serving dish with baby spinach or other plain greens. Lay a slice of terrine overtop. Either purchase ranch dressing or make a simple one by stirring ½ cup (125 mL) mayonnaise with ¼ cup (60 mL) yogurt or buttermilk, 1 small minced garlic clove and pinches of salt and pepper to taste. Mix in 1 tbsp (15 mL) of a finely chopped fresh herb such as basil, parsley or oregano. Thin with a dash or 2 of milk as needed. Decoratively drizzle ranch dressing over greens; scatter with diced peppers.
