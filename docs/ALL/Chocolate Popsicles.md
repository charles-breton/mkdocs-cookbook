# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Add coconut milk, sweetener (lower amount), cocoa and salt to a saucepan over medium heat. Mix using an immersion blender or whisk until all the solids from the coconut milk have the dissolved and the mixture is fully blended. Taste for sweetness and adjust if need be.
2. If adding the xanthan gum (see notes), sprinkle it little by little and blend until fully combined. You will likely have some air bubbles, but be sure to check there are no lumps. Any lumps will be resolved by mixing with an immersion blender (or in an actual blender). Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool completely. 
3. Transfer to popsicle molds (or an ice cube tray!) and freeze until set. Keep in the freezer for up to three months.
   
(Optional): feel free to be a little extra with your popsicles! I like adding a touch of espresso powder to enhance the chocolate, but extracts such as orange or mint will work beautifully too. Dipping in melted chocolate and sprinkling with toasted almonds is totally optional... but highly suggested!

## NOTES

*You absolutely NEED to use [full fat coconut milk](http://amzn.to/2x9N7Lq) here **for optimum creaminess** (without any coconut after taste!). Alternatively, feel free to use heavy cream and for 'lighter versions' you can use a lower-fat coconut milk (at the expense of a bit of iciness).  

**Unlike in every single other gnom-gnom keto ice cream recipe (cue in [our suuuper luscious no-churn master recipe](https://www.gnom-gnom.com/keto-ice-cream-recipe/)!), I’m going to advice against using xylitol and allulose here (as they keep your ice creams soft!). So **stick to erythritol (or pure** **monkfruit!)**, unless you want soft popsicles! 

**Fun fact:** it might also be my taste buds here, but I’ve noticed that **stevia-based sweeteners** don’t work so great when chocolate is involved as the bitter aftertaste is accentuated. So I cannot recommend enough that you don’t use stevia-based sweeteners here!

***Use the smaller amount for a 'milk chocolate' version and the larger for dark. For reference, I used 2 tablespoons of [Valrhona cocoa](http://amzn.to/2xydo3V) for these!

****Optional: **xanthan gum acts as a stabilizer**, ensuring a consistent texture while freezing (but it's also totally optional). I particularly suggest it if you're going to leave your popsicles in the freezer for a while, or if you like your texture extra creamy. Be sure to measure a **_very_ lightly packed** 1/8 teaspoon of xanthan gum, as it's an ingredient that's easy to overpack. And if you overdo it, you'll get gummy popsicles.
