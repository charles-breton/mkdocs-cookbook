# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Thaw turkey thoroughly in the refrigerator. This can take between 65 to 96 hours, depending upon the size of your turkey.
2. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
3. Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey and rinse the entire turkey, inside and out. Pat dry with paper towels.
4. Place turkey breast side up in a shallow roasting pan. Add about an inch of water.
5. Rub the turkey with the butter, ghee, or oil.
6. Combine the sea salt, rosemary and basil and rub it inside the turkey cavity and either on or under the turkey skin.
7. Cover the pan and place the turkey in the oven. For an unstuffed turkey, cook for about 20 minutes per pound for an 8 to 10 pound turkey or 14 to 16 minutes per pound for larger turkeys. (For optimum safety, stuffing a turkey is not recommended.) Remove the cover during last 1 hour of cooking time.
8. At just over half the roasting time, baste the turkey with its own juices using a spoon or baster. Baste the turkey every 20 minutes until the last half hour of roasting time then baste every 10 minutes.
9. The turkey is done when the drumsticks move easily in their sockets and the juices from the thigh run clear. A meat thermometer can be very helpful and if you do use one, it should register 170 degrees in the thigh meat.
10. Let the turkey stand for 20 to 30 minutes before carving.
