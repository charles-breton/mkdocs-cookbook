## PREP

Prep Time: 15 minutes

Cook Time: 5 minutes

Total Time: 20 minutes

Servings: 24

# INGREDIENTS

**[Faire 1/2 recette parce que la recette de base est trop grosse]**

• ▢   8 Tablespoons butter 1 stick

• ▢   4 1/2 cups sugar

• ▢   12 ounces evaporated milk 1 can

• ▢   12 ounce (340 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips

• ▢   12 ounce (340 g) milk chocolate chips (pas utilisé mis du chocolat 70% à la place)

• ▢   14 ounces marshmallow creme (198 ml x2 = ok)

• ▢   2 teaspoons vanilla

• ▢   1 cup chopped walnuts
# INSTRUCTIONS

• Mix butter, sugar and milk in saucepan. Turn heat on high. Continually stir and bring to rolling boil. Continue stirring for about 5 minutes or until it gets to a “soft ball” stage. Remove from heat; stir in the vanilla, chocolate chips, and marshmallow creme. Mix until well blended then add nuts. Pour into a buttered 9 x 13 inch pan. Cool and cut into squares. I don’t have a candy thermometer, so “soft ball” stage means that when you drop a small amount of the candy liquid into a cold cup of water, it will form into soft ball

## NOTES

**Mise en place**: Working quickly while making this fudge recipe is important. Have everything ready to go by emptying the chocolate chips into a bowl, remove the marshmallow creme from the containers into a bowl. I even empty the nuts into a small bowl ahead of time.

**Stir!** Never ever skip the instruction to constantly stir. If you don’t the mixture will stick to the bottom of the pan, reducing the amount of liquid for the creamy texture and you’ll have a mess to clean up.

**Candy Thermometer**: I highly recommend using a candy thermometer to make this recipe. They’re inexpensive and they take the worry out of cooking sugar. For instance, if you over cook the sugar to higher than the 242 degrees (soft-ball stage) there’s no turning back. The texture of the fudge will be compromised and you’ll more than likely have to start over. That’s spoken from experience. 

**Pro Tip:** Not all sauce pans are created equal. Different materials will cook the sugar mixture at slightly different times. I’ve seen recipes that say cook the sugar mixture for 5 minutes and you’ll magically reach the proper temperature to make fudge. Altitude and pan types carry too much clout to rely on a simple designated cooking time. Bad advice! I don’t know about you, but I hate throwing out food and starting over. **Use a candy thermometer please.**

**Slicing Fudge**: Let the fudge come to room temperature before cutting into squares. I find that squares just slightly over an 1 1/2 is a good measurement for a 9 x 13 pan.

**How well does fudge freeze**? Want to get a head start on your holiday baking? Make this fudge ahead and pop it in the freezer. Fudge freezes very well, with possibly just a slight alter in the texture. I like to slice the fudge into squares first. If using a container that you can layer the pieces, use parchment paper or waxed paper between layers. Unthaw fudge in the refrigerator.

**Storing Fudge:** How long does fudge last out of the fridge? Store fudge in an airtight container at room temperature. It will last one to two weeks. You can refrigerate fudge, but the cold temps will dry it out. 

**Can I half this recipe?**  Yes. This recipe is very easy to cut in half. Just use a 9 x 9 pan rather than a 9 x 13.
