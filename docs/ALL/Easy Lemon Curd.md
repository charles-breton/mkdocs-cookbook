# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a small pan, whisk together eggs, yolks, honey, lemon juice, salt and zest. Add fat of choice and turn heat to low.
2. Cook on low until fat is completely melted, stirring constantly.
3. Turn heat to medium and continue to cook and stir until mixture thickens ~ about another 5-7 minutes. You will know it is done when tiny little bubbles begin to come to the surface.
4. Immediately strain through a sieve and refrigerate. The curd will thicken even more when it sets.
