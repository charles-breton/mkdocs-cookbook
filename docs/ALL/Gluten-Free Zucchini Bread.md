# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350℉. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray.
    
2. Whisk together gluten-free flour, dark brown sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. Break up any pieces of brown sugar with your fingers. Add grated zucchini, eggs, and oil. Stir until a batter forms. Allow batter to rest for two minutes. This allows the zucchini to release a little moisture. It’s an important step. You don’t want to skip it.
    
3. Stir the batter one more time to ensure no dry flour clings to the bottom of the bowl. Spread batter evenly into prepared pan. Sprinkle chocolate chips evenly over the top of the pan.
    
4. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out with only a few crumbs clinging to it, about 45 minutes.
    
5. Place pan on wire rack. Allow bread to cool in the pan. Slide a metal spatula gently around the edges of the pan to loosen. Turn out bread. Slice with a serrated knife. Store zucchini bread, wrapped, on the counter for up to four days. To freeze: Slice bread and place parchment paper between the slices. Place the slices into a freezer bag and freeze up to three months.

## NOTES

**Grated Zucchini**

For small (under 12-inches) zucchini, there is no need to drain or blot. For large zucchini, over, blot to remove excess moisture.
