# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 3/4 cup melted coconut oil
- [ ] 9.5 Tbs. (150g) almond butter
- [ ] 60 drops (about 3/8 tsp.) liquid Stevia
- [ ] 3 Tbs. cocoa
- [ ] 9 Tbs. melted salted butter

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pour a scant 2 Tbs. into each of 24 candy or mini muffin molds.  I use a silicone candy mold that I bought at Michael's Crafts.  If you prefer, you can use those little paper mini muffin cups, lined up on a cookie sheet.
2. I place my candy mold on a small cookie sheet first, and then fill it, then put it in the freezer.  If you try to put it in the freezer without first putting it on a cookie sheet, you'll be sorry.
3. Freeze for at least 30 minutes, then pop out the Fat Bombs and store them in a bag or other container in the freezer.  You can keep them in the fridge, but as soon as you hold one with your hot little fingers, it will melt really fast.  Frozen, it melts slower.
