_Eat roasted garlic straight out of the cloves or spread onto warm bread. Mashing some into butter, sauces and creamy dips is also an excellent idea. You can use foil or parchment paper to roast garlic. If using parchment, you will need to secure the packets with kitchen twine._

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 3 whole heads garlic
- [ ] 3 sprigs fresh thyme, optional
- [ ] 1 tablespoon olive oil
- [ ] Salt and fresh ground black pepper

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Prepare three squares of parchment paper or foil large enough to wrap each head of garlic.
3. If the garlic has extra layers of papery white skin, peel them away, but leave enough layers so the head of garlic stays together. Cut a 1/4-inch from the top of the cloves so that you can see inside the individual cloves of garlic.
4. For each head of garlic, place down a sheet of parchment or foil onto a work bench. Make a small bed of thyme by shaping it into a small ring. Then place a head of garlic, cut-side-up, on top. Drizzle with olive oil and season with some salt and fresh ground black pepper.
5. Pull the sides of the parchment paper or foil up and around the garlic so that you make a little parcel. If using parchment, secure with kitchen twine.
6. Place packets of garlic onto a baking sheet. Bake until the cloves inside the packet are light brown and soft, 40 to 70 minutes. Check on the garlic every so often to see how it is progressing.

## NOTES

- If using parchment, trim excess paper from the tops of the packets so that they do not touch the top of your oven.
    
- Instead of thyme, try other fresh herbs like rosemary or dill.
    
- Storing: Roasted garlic can be refrigerated for a few days or to extend their shelf life, remove the roasted garlic cloves, add them to a clean food storage container and then cover with olive oil. Store the garlic and olive oil in the refrigerator up to two weeks (the oil can also be used) You can also freeze roasted garlic — either as whole cloves, mashed up into a puree or covered in olive oil. The frozen garlic should last up to three months.

## TIPS

Variations:

The best way to change this recipe up is to use melted butter instead of olive oil to coat the garlic. The combination of garlic, butter, and salt is wonderful.


###### Freezing Roasted Garlic

To freeze the roasted garlic, place individual roasted garlic cloves in a single layer. Freeze the garlic for 1 hour and transfer to a sealed bag or container. Frozen roasted garlic cloves will keep for up to a month.  

You can also mash or puree the roasted garlic and store them in ice cube trays to add to sauces or to make dishes such as roasted garlic mashed potatoes.
