# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Squeeze as much liquid out of the carrots as you can.
2. Combine the carrots, coconuts, dates, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and coconut flour in a food processor and pulse until they come together. It should be easy to form in to shapes. Try pressing some between your fingers to make sure it's sticking. If you are adding the trail mix, stir it in by hand.
3. Prepare the pan of your choice by lining it with parchment paper. You can use a cake pan, loaf pan, muffin tins or make patties like I did.
4. Put your cake in the freezer while you make the frosting.
5. Put the cashews, coconut oil, maple syrup, vanilla and lemon juice in a high-powered blender. Mix until completely smooth. If it get's warm while you are blending it, let it cool a bit before frosting your cakes.
6. Using an offset spatula or a large spoon, spread the frosting over the top of the cake or cupcakes. If you are making a layer cake, don't overfill the middle layers or it will ooze out the sides.
7. Top with coconut and keep chilled in fridge until ready to serve.
8. It tastes best the day after!
