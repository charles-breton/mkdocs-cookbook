# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line a [baking sheet](http://amzn.to/2xAUXzj) with [parchment paper](http://amzn.to/2DAVsMq) or wax paper. Clear some space in the freezer for this sheet. Set aside at room temperature.
2. In a medium bowl, add peanut butter, maple syrup, [coconut flour](https://amzn.to/2Ix6yRn) and cacao powder. Whisk as long as you can. When the mixture gets harder to stir, use a rubber spatula to fold until well incorporated. Fold until thickened.
3. Using a cookie scoop, scoop and drop peanut butter balls onto the prepared baking sheet, spaced evenly apart. Here are the [1-tablespoon](http://amzn.to/2whOHZF) and [2-tablespoon cookie scoops](http://amzn.to/2tRInJ5) I use.
4. Transfer to the freezer to chill for 20-30 minutes, until somewhat firm.* Remove from freezer and roll into balls, or enjoy as is! Enjoy!

## NOTES

- Adapted from my [3 Ingredient Peanut Butter No Bake Energy Bites](https://beamingbaker.com/3-ingredient-peanut-butter-no-bake-energy-bites-recipe-gluten-free-vegan-protein-packed/).
- *Bites will become firmer and less moist the next day.
- **Storage Notes:** Store in an airtight container at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 1-3 weeks. Bites will become drier, but are still tasty in the 3rd week.
- **Nutrition Information**: is an estimate based on the ingredients listed in Where to Buy Ingredients. Also, it’s estimated based on 23 servings per recipe.
- **Freezing instructions:** store in an airtight container in the freezer for 1-2 months. Firm, but soft enough to eat straight out of the freezer.
