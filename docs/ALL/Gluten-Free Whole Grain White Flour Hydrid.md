Making your own gluten free blend is simple and can be very cost effective.  Everyone has their own favorite gluten free flour blend.  Store bought blends tends to lack nutrition in my opinion.  Not to mention flavor and texture.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix well in a large bowl.  Store container in refrigerator or freezer to help preserve nutrients.  Teff and millet flours are perishable.  You should always refrigerate or freeze unused flours even if it’s not mixed.  I’ve read it can go rancid fast, although I’ve had my mixed bags in the refrigerator for several weeks with no problems.

## NOTES

You’ll notice I don’t add xanthan or guar gum.  This way it can truly be _all purpose_.   You’ll probably need to add some eventually, depending upon its use.
