# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Line a baking pan with wax paper, set aside. (You will not be baking these, you just need a place to set your rolled bites as you make them).
    
2. Put dates, pecans and cashews in your [food processor](http://amzn.to/260Ukqr) fitted with an “S” blade or in your [Vitamix](http://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8438233-13084479). Process until mixture is fine and homogeneous.
    
3. Add the rest of the ingredients in the order listed (cocoa powder, salt, almond butter, almond milk, & vanilla) to your food processor and process until mixture just starts to clump together.
    
4. Roll 1 TBS portions of your “dough” into balls and place them on your prepared baking sheet.
    
5. Put them in the fridge or freezer until they harden.
    
6. Transfer to an airtight container to save for later! These can be stored at room temperature, but will last longer when kept in the fridge or freezer! I think they taste the best cold/frozen!
