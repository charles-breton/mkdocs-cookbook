Prep time: 10 mins Cook time: 5 mins Total time: 15 mins

Serves: 4


## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

½ Cup Raw Cashews

1 Cup Water

3 Tablespoons + 2 teaspoons Tapioca Starch (also known as Tapioca Flour)

1 Tablespoon Nutritional Yeast

1 teaspoon Apple Cider Vinegar

½ teaspoon Salt

¼ teaspoon Garlic Powder

INSTRUCTIONS



# INSTRUCTIONS

Add the cashews to a small pot and with water. Bring to a boil for 10 to 15 minutes until they are softened. This will make them easier to blend.

Drain and rinse the cashews and add them along with the 1 cup of water and all the remaining ingredients to a blender. Blend until completely smooth. It will be very watery.

Pour into a small sauce pan over medium-high heat, and continually stir as it cooks. As you stir it will start forming clumps, and then all of a sudden it will become a cheesy gooey mass of yumminess. This takes about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir for an additional minute to make sure it has firmed up completely. Serve hot. Store in an airtight container in the fridge.



## TIPS

*Tapioca starch is essential for this recipe. It is what give the cheese it’s gooey and stretchy texture. 

*If you want to return the cold mozzarella back to dipping consistency, reheat over medium heat while stirring constantly so it doesn't burn. Once it is hot and bubbling it might have thickened up too much. You can thin it out by adding a tablespoon of water at a time, stirring it in until desired consistency is reached.

*If you don't have a high-powered blender, you may want to pour the liquid through a fine mesh strainer or cheese cloth before cooking to remove any cashew bits that didn't grind up. This will ensure a smooth cheese texture.
