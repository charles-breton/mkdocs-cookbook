_I really enjoy grilled sea scallops especially when served with Mediterranean herbs and wild mushrooms. Select any mushroom that you enjoy. I recommend that you serve this with a green salad or a generous portion of green vegetables on the side._

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Rinse scallops, pat completely dry with paper towels, and place in a bowl. Combine with avocado oil, thyme, salt and pepper and marinate for 10-20 minutes.
2. Pre-heat grill (or broiler) and prep mushrooms, garlic, and parsley.
3. Heat a medium sauté pain to medium heat, add olive oil, then add mushrooms, salt, black pepper, and heat for 3-4 minutes with an occasional stir until mushrooms have softened. Add wine, garlic, and parsley, stir and cover. Heat another 2 minutes, remove from heat but keep covered.
4. Once grill is hot, sear on both sides for 2 minutes. If you are using the broiler instead, plan scallops in an ovenproof pan under the top rack of the oven. After two minutes, turn the scallops and return to the top shelf in the oven. They should be slightly browned on both sides and still be moist and tender in the center. Avoid overcooking or they will be dry and tough.
5. After turning scallops to cook on the second side, resume medium heat in the sauté pan with the mushrooms.
6. Add scallops to serving plates, spoon mushrooms around the scallops. Serve with a side green salad or a side green vegetable.
