# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 tsp sea salt

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Combine the tapioca flour, salt, and just 1/4 C. of coconut flour in a bowl and stir until combined.
3. Add the water and oil, in addition to the egg and mix well just until combined.
4. Check the dough - if the dough mixture is too thin then you will need to add more coconut flour, just a spoon or two at a time until the dough is more thick. (Add no more than a total of 1/3 C. coconut flour).
5. Coat your hands with a small amount of tapioca flour, and take 2 scoops of batter in your palm.
6. Roll the batter into balls (you should get 8-10 rolls), and place on a greased baking pan.
7. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until brown.
8. Serve warm with a small amount of butter.
