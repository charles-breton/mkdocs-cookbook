# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat oil in a large pan/skillet, add onion and fry for about 5 minutes. Add garlic and fry for a further 1 minute.
2. Now add the mushrooms and fry over medium heat for about 5 minutes.
3. Pour in white wine (optional), vegetable broth, tamari (or soy sauce), and the spice mixture. I love adding nutritional yeast flakes as well but that's optional! Bring to a boil.
4. Add cornstarch to the plant-based milk or cream (I used canned coconut milk, however, almond milk, oat milk/cream or soy milk/cream is fine too) and stir to dissolve.
5. Pour the milk/cream mixture into the pan and cook on low-medium heat for about 10 minutes until the sauce thickens. Taste and adjust seasonings as to your preference.
6. Add fresh thyme leaves and/or parsley and/or tarragon to taste! Enjoy with brown rice or pasta of choice! This creamy mushroom sauce also tastes great over mashed potatoes!

## NOTES

- **Mushrooms:** You can use white button mushrooms or cremini mushrooms_._
- **Wine:** I prefer a dry white wine but you can leave it out or substitute 1/2 tbsp of balsamic vinegar.
- **Milk:** Any plant-based milk works in this recipe. I often use canned coconut milk (because it's higher in fat and makes the sauce creamier and richer) but cashew milk, almond milk, etc. will be fine too.
