# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 375° (F).

Brush 4 teaspoons of olive oil over cut face of eggplant. Sprinkle on ¼ teaspoon of salt. Place in an ovenproof pan, cut surface facing up, and bake for 45-50 minutes until eggplant softens, and flesh can be scooped from the skin—keeping skin intact for stuffing.

Meanwhile, heat a medium sauté pan to medium, add 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon of olive oil, then the onion, 1 teaspoon of Herbes de Provence, and ¼ teaspoon salt. Stir occasionally for 2 minutes until onion softens, then add chopped walnuts, heat another 1 minute, and remove from heat, and once eggplant has been removed from skin, combine onion and herbs in a bowl with eggplant scooped from skins.

Heat the same pan to medium, add 1 teaspoon olive oil, then garlic plus 1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence. Sauté for 1 minute, then add tomato sauce, simmer for 2 minutes, and remove from heat.

Stuff onion-eggplant-walnut mixture back into eggplant skin in the ovenproof pan.

Spoon tomato sauce with garlic and herbs over the stuffed eggplants. Add slices of goat cheese.

Return to the oven and bake at 375° for 15 minutes. Garnish with basil leaf strips and serve.
