# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 250 g (8.5 oz) good quality dark eating chocolate, chopped (70 – 85 % cocoa solids) I used Lindt 70 %
- [ ] 250 ml (8.5 fl oz) cream or  alternatively you can use coconut cream or milk if dairy free
- [ ] pinch of salt

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Chop your chocolate finely. If I'm using a large block of chocolate I like to shave it with a large knife, making sure there are no big pieces.
2. Pour the cream in a pot over a medium heat and simmer until just before boiling - do not boil.
3. Remove the pot from the heat.
4. Add the chocolate to the cream and a pinch of salt
5. Stand for 3 minutes without stirring.
6. Stir gently until smooth after 2 minutes - you don't want to overwork the ganache and the mix should look glossy and smooth.
7. Pour over your cake to coat if covering the whole cake and you want a lovely glossy finish.

**Or**

7. Cool your ganache at room temperature then spread it over the top of your favourite chocolate cake.
