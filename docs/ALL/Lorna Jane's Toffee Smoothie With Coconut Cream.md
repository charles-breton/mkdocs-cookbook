# INSTRUCTIONS

#### For the toffee sauce:

1. Blend all ingredients together until a sauce forms. If not thick enough, add more dates. The sauce will need to be thick to be drizzled around the jar/glass.

#### For the smoothie:_

2. Blend all ingredients together in a high-speed blender until combined.

#### _For topping:_

3. Chill coconut cream can in the fridge overnight. The next day, remove the can from the fridge without tipping or shaking and remove the lid. Scrape out the top of thickened cream and leave the liquid behind (reserve for use in other smoothies). Chill a large mixing bowl 10 minutes before whipping. Place cream in chilled mixing bowl. Beat with a mixer until it reaches whipped cream consistency.

#### _To assemble:_

4. Drizzle a little of the toffee sauce around a glass. Add smoothie, leaving an inch of space at the top. Top smoothie with whipped coconut cream topping, extra banana pieces and another drizzle of toffee sauce.
