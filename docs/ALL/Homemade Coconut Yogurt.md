Pair homemade yogurt with a good source of prebiotic fiber, such as blueberries, apples, chia seeds, or oats. This will give your body the opportunity to utilize probiotics effectively. While this yogurt makes for a great parfait, it’s also a natural addition to smoothies, baked goods (use it to replace sour cream, buttermilk, or cow’s milk yogurt), and overnight oats.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Sterilize a quart size glass jar by running it through the dishwasher on high heat or filling it with boiling water for a few minutes.
2. Whisk coconut milk and tapioca starch together in a medium saucepan. Heat to a simmer over medium-low heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes, or until thickened. Allow the mixture to cool until slightly warm.
3. Open the probiotic capsules and add the powder inside to the coconut mixture (discard the plastic casings). Add the maple syrup as well and whisk. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise with a sharp knife and scrape the seeds and paste inside the pod into the yogurt mixture. Whisk well.
4. Pour yogurt mixture into the sterilized jar and screw on the lid. Leave undisturbed in a warm place for 24 hours. After the yogurt has set, refrigerate for at least 4 hours before eating. Stir well and enjoy! Yogurt will keep in a sealed jar in the refrigerator for up to ten days.
