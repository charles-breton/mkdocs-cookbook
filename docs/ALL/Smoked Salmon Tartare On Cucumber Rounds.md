## PREP | COMMENTS

This recipe is from my book [Everyone Can Cook for Celebrations](https://web.archive.org/web/20180823042910/http://www.everyonecancook.com/books/everyone-can-cook-for-celebrations-seasonal-recipes-for-festive-occasions). It’s a significant spin on the classic dish beef tartare, where the raw meat is chopped and mixed with tangy flavorings and displayed in patty-like form on a plate. In this version, there are still tangy flavorings, but finely chopped, smoked salmon replaces the beef and an decedent appetizer created by spooning the tartare mixture on to palate-refreshing slices of cucumber.

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 4 ounces (114g) smoked salmon, finely chopped, we used sockeye smoked wild salmon
- [ ] 3 tablespoons finely chopped red onion
- [ ] 1 tablespoon small capers, drained

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the olive oil, lemon juice and Dijon mustard. Add salmon, onion, capers, and dill and stir to combine. Grind some black pepper over the mixture and taste for seasonings and adjust as necessary.
2. Using a small melon baller or spoon, scoop out some of the center portion of each cucumber slice, making sure not to go all the way through the cucumber. Mound 2 teaspoons of the smoked salmon tartare in the center of the cucumber slice (I used the melon baller for this). Garnish with tiny sprigs of fresh dill if desired. Serve right away or store on a covered tray in the refrigerator for several hours in advance of serving.
