## NOTES


 I updated the recipe to include 1/4 tsp of pink Himalayan salt instead of 1/2 tsp because a couple of my batches tasted a bit too salty.

## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

Dry:

- 2 cups almond flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp pink Himalayan salt

Wet:

- 1/4 cup raw honey
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 egg, room temperature
- 2/3 cup chocolate chips

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, whisk together all the dry ingredients (except the chocolate chips): **[almond flour](https://amzn.to/2INwVn0)**, baking soda, and **[pink salt](https://amzn.to/2HPXsm3)**.
    
2. In a small bowl, whisk together all the wet ingredients: **[honey](https://amzn.to/2G3yaAX)**, melted **[coconut oil](https://amzn.to/2JpoMop)**, vanilla extract, and egg. Once combined, add the wet ingredients to the dry, and whisk them together.
    
3. Stir in the **[chocolate chips](https://amzn.to/2IP8m9a)**, cover the bowl with a towel, and refrigerate the dough for 20 minutes.
    
4. Preheat the oven to 350°F, and lightly spray a cookie sheet with coconut oil. When the dough is done chilling, form it into small balls and space them out about two inches from each other on the cookie sheet.
    
5. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. Let the cookies set on the sheet to cool for 10 minutes before transferring them to a rack to cool completely. Enjoy!
