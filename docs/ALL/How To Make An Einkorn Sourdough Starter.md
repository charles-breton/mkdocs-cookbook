## PREP | COMMENTS

It will normally take 6 to 10 days to get your starter strong enough to bake great bread. At that point, the starter may be stored in the refrigerator and refreshed just once a week. You can create and maintain the starter with either all-purpose or whole grain einkorn flour. The whole grain flour contains 100 percent of the seed and a bit more of the wild yeasts, which can help things to move along quicker in the beginning, but both flours will end up working equally as well.

# INGREDIENTS


#### To Begin The Starter

- [ ] 3 tablespoons (45 g) warm water, at 100°F/37.8°C
- [ ] 1⁄2 cup (60 g) all-purpose einkorn flour or 1⁄2 cup (48 g) whole grain einkorn flour, plus more for dusting

#### To Feed The Starter

- [ ] 2 tablespoons (30 g) warm water, at 100°F/37.8°C
- [ ] 1⁄2 cup (60 g) all-purpose einkorn flour or 1⁄2 cup (48 g) whole grain einkorn flour, plus more for dusting
- [ ] To Feed And Finish The Starter
- [ ] 2 tablespoons (30 g) warm water
- [ ] 1⁄2 cup (60 g) all-purpose einkorn flour or 1⁄2 cup (48 g) whole grain einkorn flour, plus more for dusting

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. (a) In a small bowl, mix together the water and flour with a fork to form a wet dough. (b) Dust your hands lightly with flour, scrape up the dough, and roll gently between your hands into a sticky ball without adding more flour. (c) Transfer to a sealable glass jar or container, or simply leave it in the bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Store the bowl in a dark place for 48 hours where it is at least 68°F/20°C.
2. After 48 hours of resting, the starter should smell sharp and have expanded minimally, with bubbles visible under the pale gray surface of the dough. (d) With a fork, gently push aside and discard the gray surface of the dough. (e) Gather up the remaining starter and transfer it to another medium bowl. Add the water and mix until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the flour and mix until a wet dough is formed.
3. Dust your hands lightly with flour, scrape up the dough, and roll gently between your hands into a sticky ball without adding more flour. Transfer to a clean and dry sealable glass jar or container or to a clean bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Store in a dark place for 24 hours where it is at least 68°F. (Some say you should cover the container with a cotton towel so the starter is able to catch wild yeasts in your kitchen. However, all of the wild yeast you need is already in the flour, and the added air can form a skin on the surface of the starter.)
4. After the fed starter has rested 24 hours, it should begin to change from a sharp to a sweeter, yogurtlike smell. You should begin to see bubbles not only under the surface of the dough, but also on top. (f) If you still see a grayish hue on the surface of the starter, push it aside with a fork and discard it. Add the water and mix until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the flour and mix until a wet dough is formed. Dust your hands lightly with flour, scrape up the dough, and roll gently with your hands into a sticky ball without adding more flour. Transfer to a clean and dry sealable glass jar or container or simply transfer to a new bowl and tightly seal with plastic wrap. Store in a dark place for 24 hours where it is at least 68°F/20°C.
5. After this final 24 hours, you may bake with the starter, but it will not be as mature as the starter used in my recipes. (g) Therefore, the proofing times will need to be increased from 3 to 5 hours to 12 to 15 hours, or your bread may bake dense until you have the proper balance of acids. I recommend strengthening your starter even further before you mix your first loaf of bread. To do this, you should refresh your starter (see page 13 of Einkorn cookbook) at least 5 times until it bubbles up and subsides in less than 5 hours after each refreshing. You can still bake great bread while your starter is maturing, by using Yeast Levain (page 14 of Einkorn cookbook) and mixing in the excess starter you have each time you refresh.
6. The same recipe for refreshing is used to strengthen your new starter and to maintain your mature starter forever. Once your starter is strong enough to leaven the dough in the times indicated in each recipe, you will only need to refresh your starter weekly to keep it strong. However, if you are away, even for a few weeks, your starter will survive just fine without refreshing if stored in a sealed container in the refrigerator. (I’ve given you quantities for refreshing your starter based on how many loaves of bread you might want to make each week.)
