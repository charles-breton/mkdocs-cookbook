# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Need 3 bowls for this to work well (one large one for the dough to rise in).
    
2. Pour yeast into one bowl. Combine warm water and honey in a measuring cup. Pour over the yeast. (Brasser pour bien dissoudre la levure et mettre un saran wrap dessus) Let sit for about 8 to 10 minutes, until mixture is foamy (almost like head on a beer). Meanwhile, combine the 2 flours in another bowl (and add the herbs to the flour). (Faire un puits au centre pour y verser le mélange avec la levure.)Set aside.
    
3. Add olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture. (Et verser dans le puits la farine au complet.)
    
4. Mix well. No: (Add 1 cup of the flour mixture. Using a wooden spoon, stir until smooth (don’t over do or you’ll exhaust the dough). Add a second cup of the flour mixture and )continue to stir until dough forms a soft and sticky mass and comes away from the sides of the bowl.
    
5. Flour a work surface lightly (and your hands) with some of the remaining flour mixture. Turn the dough out onto the surface and knead more flour in until the dough is smooth and elastic. (Just enough until its not sticky anymore basically, just add a little at a time) Don’t worry if you don’t use up all the flour. Shape the dough into a ball. Coat your large bowl with some olive oil and place dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place for 45 - 60 minutes, until it doubles in size.
    
6. Where do I let it rise in a warm place??? Well, when dough is in a ball, turn on your oven to 200 degrees and time for 2 minutes, then turn the oven off and place the bowl (with the dough) in the oven and close the door. Let sit for about an hour and your done!!!
    
7. Coat 2 12″ pizza pans with olive oil and sprinkle some of the cornmeal over the oil. This seriously helps it not stick to the pan. Punch down the dough and return to a lightly floured work area. Divide the dough into two(4) balls. Using a rolling pin, roll out each ball to roughly a 12″ circle. Place the dough in the pizza pan and fold over any excess to make the crust edges. Add your favorite toppings (faire revenir les légumes dans une poële) Sauce en premier, viande, fromage et légumes sur le dessus.  Bake at 450 (425F) degrees for 11 - 13 (20)(17 Sophie) minutes. It is important to not overwork the dough or it will become a bit tough.
