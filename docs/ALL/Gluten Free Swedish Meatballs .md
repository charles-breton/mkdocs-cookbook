3 cups chicken stock - or beef stock

# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Make Gluten Free Swedish Meatballs

#### **Step 1. Prepare ingredients for meatballs**:

- Toast and ground the gluten free bread (store bought or homemade) into bread crumbs with a food processor. This way I’m replacing the store-bought bread crumbs with gluten free bread crumbs (I’m using my homemade [gluten free bread](https://healthytasteoflife.com/gluten-free-sourdough-bread-vegan-yeast-free-gum-free/)).
    
- I also replaced the pork meat with some lean ground turkey. Turkey meatballs are lighter than traditional Swedish Meatballs plus healthier.
    

#### **Step 2. Mix the meatball ingredients**:

- Heat avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat and sauté the onions and garlic until soft. Set aside to cool down because we’re going to add all the other ingredients in the same skillet to save dirty dishes.
    
- To the sautéed onions and garlic, add the bread crumbs, the egg, plant milk, seasonings, the ground beef and the ground turkey. Combine all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix with your hand until everything looks uniformly combined, don’t overwork it.
    
    Pinch the meat between your fingers rather than kneading it.
    

#### **Step 3. Form the meatballs**:

- Pinch off a piece of the meat mixture and gently roll between your hands to form 1-inch meatballs (about 1.5 tablespoons each).
    
- Place on a baking sheet (I used 2 **oblong glass baking dishes**) and repeat until all meatball mixture is used up.
    

#### **Step 4. Roast the meatballs in the oven**:

- Bake the gluten free meatballs in a preheated oven at 410-425F for 20 minutes. The high temperature will give the meatballs a nice brown color on the surface.
    
- You can roast the meatballs under the broiler (for the last 2 minutes) for maximum browning and crispy-edged effect.
    

####  Make The Dairy Free Swedish Meatball Sauce

#### **Step 1. Gather the gravy ingredients and cook in a skillet**:

- While the meatballs are baking in the oven prepare the gravy, it’s similar to a roux. In a skillet melt the [plant-based butter](https://amzn.to/3t66CBE) over low-medium heat.
    
- Add cassava flour, cook while whisking, until golden brown and bubbly, about 3 minutes. If you want the sauce on the thicker side add another tablespoon of cassava flour.
    

#### **Step 2. Add stock to make the dairy free sauce:**

- Then slowly pour in half of the chicken stock (or whatever stock you have). Whisk vigorously. The mixture will thin out as the remaining stock is whisked in.
    
- Then add the rest of ingredients. When everything is incorporated and smooth, increase heat to medium and whisk until thickens a bit. 
    
    Then remove from heat.
    

#### **Heat The Gluten Free Meatballs In Dairy Free Sauce:**

- Remove the gluten free Swedish meatballs from the oven and pour the dairy free sauce in the same baking dish where the meatballs were baked. The juices leaked from the meatballs will add extra flavor to the gravy.
    
- Give it a good mix to coat the meatballs. Return to the oven for another 5-7 minutes to warm them up.

## NOTES

#### **Serve These Gluten Free Swedish Meatballs With:**

spiralized veggies, mashed vegetables like white potatoes, sweet potatoes or cauliflower, gluten free pasta, boiled rice or boiled potatoes, rice noodles, oven roasted vegetables, or along your favorite salad.

 

#### **Make Gluten Free Swedish Meatballs Without Eggs:**

Those allergic to eggs can easily remove the egg from the recipe, the meatballs will hold their shape just fine. I tried making my meatballs without eggs multiple times! 

 

#### **Make Paleo or Whole30 compliant Swedish meatballs:**

- Make sure you use a compliant mustard, without sugar or white wine. I always use this apple cider stone ground brown mustard with simple great ingredients.
- For the meatballs: replace the breadcrumbs with almond meal or if you can’t have nuts: some grated vegetables like sweet potatoes, carrots or cauliflower will do.
- For the gravy replace the cassava flour with [arrowroot powder](https://amzn.to/2Q6X728), same amount.
- If you must serve your gluten free Swedish meatballs with jelly then choose a sugar free fruit jam like this one, but you can also omit it entirely.

 

#### **Make Keto Swedish Meatballs:**

- Replace the breadcrumbs with almond meal or grated vegetables: zucchini, cauliflower or maybe even some mushrooms. For the gravy replace the cassava flour with arrowroot powder and you’re good. If you can have dairy you can also replace the coconut cream with regular sour cream.
