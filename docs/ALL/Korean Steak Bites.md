## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

• 1½ lb sirloin steak or ribeye, strip steak, or tenderloin

• 1 tbsp avocado oil or your favorite cooking oil, for stovetop method

• For garnish: Sesame seeds and chopped green onions omit sesame seeds for AIP

#### Marinade

• 1/2 cup coconut aminos

• 2 tbsp toasted sesame oil or olive oil for AIP

• 4 garlic cloves peeled

• 1 pitted medjool date OR 2 tsp maple syrup for non-Whole30

• 1 inch fresh ginger

• Optional: 2 tsp gochugaru (Korean chili pepper flakes) – omit for AIP




# INSTRUCTIONS

- Cut the steak into 1 inch cubes or bite-sized pieces and place in a resealable bag.
    
- Place all ingredients for the marinade in a blender and blend until smooth.
    
- Pour over the steak, seal the bag, and massage the steak to coat. Place in the fridge to marinate for 2 hours to overnight.
    
- Remove from fridge and drain the steak. Discard the marinade.
    

#### Stovetop Method

- Heat avocado oil on a large skillet over medium high heat.
    
- Once the pan is sizzling hot, add the steak pieces in a single layer and sear for 2 minutes.
    
- Flip the steak pieces and cook for another 2 minutes until cooked through and golden brown.
    
- Remove from heat and garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions before serving.
    

#### Air Fryer Method

- Preheat the air fryer at 400 degrees for 5 minutes.
    
- Add the steak bites to the air fryer in a single layer. You may need to cook them in 2 batches to do this.
    
- Cook for 10 minutes, flipping the pieces halfway through.
    
- Remove from the air fryer once golden brown and cooked through. Garnish with sesame seeds and chopped green onions before serving.
