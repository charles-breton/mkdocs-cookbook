## PREP | COMMENTS

 I used vegan butter (I’ve made the recipe using both Melt brand vegan butter and Miyoko’s Kitchen cultured vegan butter (now available at my local Trader Joe’s!)) in place of the butter. In place of the yogurt, I used plain So Delicious brand yogurt. Both substitutes worked great, but to get the proper thick, glossy consistency in the batter, I had to add 1 tablespoon of lukewarm water.

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 cup (140 g) all-purpose gluten free flour (I used Better Batter)
- [ ] 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum (omit if your blend already contains it)
- [ ] 1/2 cup (40 g) unsweetened cocoa powder (I prefer Dutch-processed, but natural works as well)
- [ ] 1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar
- [ ] 1/2 cup (109 g) packed light brown sugar
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- [ ] 6 tablespoons (84 g) unsalted butter, melted and cooled
- [ ] 2 tablespoons (28 g) plain yogurt, at room temperature
- [ ] 2 eggs (100 g, weighed out of shell) at room temperature, beaten
- [ ] 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat your oven to 325°F. Grease a 24-cup miniature muffin pan and set it aside.
2. In a large bowl, place the flour blend, xanthan gum, cocoa powder, granulated sugar, brown sugar, salt and baking soda, and whisk to combine well. Break up any lumps in the brown sugar, and create a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Into the well, place the melted butter, yogurt, eggs and vanilla, and mix to combine. The batter will be thick and glossy. Divide the batter evenly among the 24 prepared muffin cups. Shake the muffin tin back and forth vigorously until the batter in each cup is smooth and even on top.
3. Place the tin in the center of the preheated oven and bake until puffed and round, and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (about 12 minutes). Remove from the oven and allow to cool in the muffin tin for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
