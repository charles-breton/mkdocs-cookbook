## PREP | COMMENTS

See notebooks Sprouting pour les instructions pour le sprouting et aussi le lien plus haut.

Start this recipe the day before by sprouting a cup of quinoa and a cup of raw almondsâ€”or more, if you snack like I do.

I prefer to put it all together and serve it warm, but you can also serve the salad at room temperature or cold.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Turn the oven to 400 degrees F.
2. Toss the potatoes and carrots in a tablespoon or two of olive oil, and a half-teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Put them on a baking sheet, and bake for 30 minutes. Stir once, about halfway through. Peel the almonds. The skins should come off easily.
3. Add the quinoa to a pot with two cups of water. Cover, and cook for 5 minutes on high, then turn down to low for another five minutes. Let it sit with the lid on for 20 minutes.
4. In a large bowl, combine the potatoes, quinoa, onion, garlic, parsley, lemon juice, almonds, and the remaining olive oil. Season with salt, pepper, and chile flakes. Mix. Season again, and serve.
