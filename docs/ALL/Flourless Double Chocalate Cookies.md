## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

• 2 egg

• 2 cup coconut sugar 

• 2 cup peanut butter or almond butter, cold from the fridge. (If not using cold, let batter rest in fridge for 60 min before

rolling into cookies)

• 2 tsp. vanilla extract

• 2/3 cup cocoa powder

• 2 tsp. baking soda

• pinch of salt if nut butter isn’t salted (x2)

• 1 cup chocolate chips



# INSTRUCTIONS

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

In a large bowl, whisk together egg and coconut sugar.

Stir in peanut butter and vanilla.

Then add cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt – stir until combined. It may get thick here, almost like playdough, but stir until completely combined.

Stir in chocolate chips.

Using around two tablespoons of dough, roll in balls and place on parchment lined baking sheet.

Add more chocolate chips into the top if desired.

Bake for 10-12 minutes.

Let cool for 10 minutes before removing from pan
