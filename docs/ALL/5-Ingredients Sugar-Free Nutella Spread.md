# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    
2. Arrange the hazelnuts in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast for 8-10 minutes, until they are browned and fragrant.
    
3. Place the hazelnuts into a large container or bowl with a lid. Shake vigorously to remove loose skins. Repeat the process as needed, setting aside hazelnuts that already have their skins removed, until most of the skins are off. (Alternatively, rub the hazelnuts inside a folded towel to remove the skins.)
    
4. Place the skinned hazelnuts into a high-power blender, like the Blendtec 625. Process for 1-3 minutes, scraping the sides as needed, until the nuts begin to release oil and then form a smooth nut butter. (The Blendtec Twister Jar works well for this - just turn the lid counterclockwise as the blender runs.)
    
5. Add the powdered erythritol, cocoa powder, avocado oil (start with 1 tbsp), and vanilla extract. Process for an additional 1-2 minutes, until the spread is smooth and glossy.
    
6. If the spread is thicker than you would like, you can add a little more avocado oil, a teaspoon at a time, and process again, until you reach the desired consistency. Similarly, you can add additional sweetener to taste if you'd like.
