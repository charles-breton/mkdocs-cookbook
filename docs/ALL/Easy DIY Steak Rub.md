## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

1/4 cup Brown sugar

1 tbsp Paprika

1 tbsp Black pepper (table ground)

2 tbsp Kosher salt

1 tbsp Chili powder

1 tbsp Onion powder

1 tbsp Garlic powder

1 tsp Coriander

1 tsp Cayenne


# INSTRUCTIONS



## NUTRITIONS



## NOTES

This is a good base for all meats but donâ€™t be afraid to have fun. Separate small amounts of the rub and add a teaspoon of finely ground coffee, Italian seasoning, or any dried herb for extra punch.

## TIPS

You can either store leftover rub in the freezer in a ziplock bag with air removed or in your cupboard in an air-tight container.
