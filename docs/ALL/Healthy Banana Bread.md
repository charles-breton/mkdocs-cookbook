# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 300 degrees F

2. Use butter to liberally coat a glass baking pan

3. Mix eggs, butter, stevia, and bananas in mixing bowl (I use a hand mixer)

4. Add cinnamon, coconut flour, baking powder, and baking soda, and mix well

5. If you do not have insulin resistance and want a treat you can add one-half cup of bittersweet chocolate chips

6. Mix well and put in buttered glass baking pan

7. Put in 300 degree F oven and bake for 50 minutes. At that time turn the oven off and leave the loaf in the hot oven for an additional 10 minutes

8. Insert a toothpick into the bread; if it comes out dry you know it is done, if not leave in the oven until the toothpick comes out dry after inserting

9. When toothpick is dry take bread out of oven and let cool for 30 minutes before eating
