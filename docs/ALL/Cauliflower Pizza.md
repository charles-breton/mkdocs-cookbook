## NOTES

This is what happens when you combine the caramelized, golden-edged goodness of roasted cauliflower with melty pockets of mozzarella, crispy pepperoni, and your other favorite pizza toppings. Serve it to cauliflower lovers, or even the haters. Trust me, it’ll make you see cauliflower in a whole new way. —



## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 1/2 pound (about 2 links) uncooked Italian sausage, removed from casings and cut into 1/2-inch pieces  
    
- 2 tablespoons olive [avocado] oil [or duck fat], divided  
    
- 1 large head of cauliflower, trimmed and cut into small, bite-sized florets  
    
- 1/2 cup pizza sauce, divided  
    
- 1/4 cup finely grated parmesan, plus more for finishing dish  
    
- Kosher salt + freshly ground black pepper, to taste  
    
- 1/4 cup black olives (I like to use the sliced, canned kind)  [optional]
    
- 1/4 cup slivered or halved sun-dried tomatoes packed in olive oil (drained of oil before using)  [optional]
    
- 2 to 3 ounces pepperoni  
    
- 4 ounces fresh mozzarella (sold in rounds or logs), torn into bite-sized pieces  
    
- A big handful of fresh basil leaves, torn. [Dry basil works too]


# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Heat oven to 425 F. Place a parchment-lined sheet pan in the oven while it heats. The hot pan will help the sausage to get nicely browned, fast!
2. Working quickly, transfer the sausage to the preheated sheet pan in a single, even layer. (Careful, the pan will be hot!) Drizzle the sausage with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Roast for about 6 to 8 minutes, or until the sausage is starting to brown (set a timer).
3. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine cauliflower florets with 1/4 cup pizza sauce, 1/4 cup grated parmesan, and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and toss. You want the pizza sauce to lightly yet thoroughly coat the florets; add another tablespoon of sauce, if needed. Add olives and sun-dried tomatoes to the bowl and toss again.
4. When the timer for the sausage goes off, add the cauliflower mixture to the sheet pan, stirring a few times to coat the cauliflower in the sausage fat. Arrange pepperoni evenly across the top.
5. Roast for 15 more minutes, until the cauliflower is crisp-tender and the pepperoni has browned. (Taste a piece of cauliflower; if it isn’t approaching tender, return to the oven for a few more minutes before proceeding to Step 6. Season with a little more salt and pepper, if needed.)
6. Remove sheet pan from oven, and spoon 1/4 cup more sauce over the cauliflower mixture; add a little extra, if desired, for a saucier version. Arrange bites of torn mozzarella over (and in between) the cauliflower florets (avoid putting it directly on the bottom of the sheet pan). Roast in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce is warmed and cheese is melted.
7. Cool for about 5 minutes, then grate more parmesan on top and scatter the basil. Serve warm.
