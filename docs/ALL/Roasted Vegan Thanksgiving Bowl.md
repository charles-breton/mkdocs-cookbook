# INSTRUCTIONS

#### ROASTED VEGETABLES

1. Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium sized bowl, mix carrots and acorn squash with olive oil, brown sugar, and salt. Spread carrots and squash out on the baking sheet.
3. In the same bowl used for the carrots and squash, mix the Brussels sprouts with olive oil, brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Spread Brussels sprouts out on the same baking sheet.
4. Finally, in the same bowl, mix the broccoli with olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper. Massage the olive oil and garlic into the tops of the florets. Spread the broccoli on the baking sheet.
5. While roasting the vegetables, begin preparing your mashed potatoes and gravy at the same time.  
    Bake vegetables for 10-15 minutes. Flip/stir the vegetables and sprinkle with ¼ cup of chopped pecans. Top the squash with an extra sprinkle of brown sugar. Cook for an additional 10-15 minutes.

#### MASHED CREAMER POTATOES

1. Add potatoes to a large pot of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Boil the potatoes for 15 minutes (until the largest potato is fork tender).
2. Drain and mash potatoes.
3. Stir in the vegetable broth, vegan butter, salt, dried thyme and oregano. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and if desired, extra butter and a splash of unsweetened or original non-dairy milk.

#### EASY VEGAN GRAVY

1. In a small saucepan heat vegan butter over medium heat. Once hot, whisk in the flour, salt, thyme, and oregano. Cook for 1 minute, whisking constantly. Gradually add the vegetable broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
2. Simmer for 3-5 minutes until desired consistency is reached (the gravy will thicken slightly as it cools). If desired, adjust the consistency with extra vegetable broth. Taste and adjust seasoning.
