# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Use a vegetable peeler or mandolin to slice the ginger into thin strips. Transfer to a bowl and sprinkle with salt. Stir until well combined. Set aside for 30 minutes to allow the salt to extract excess liquid. Use your hands to squeeze any excess liquid from the ginger. Transfer the ginger to a sterilised jar.
2. Stir the rice wine vinegar, water and sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Increase heat to high. Bring to the boil. Pour the vinegar mixture over ginger. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly. Seal and place in the fridge for 24 hours to develop the flavours.
