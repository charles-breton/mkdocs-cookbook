# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Make 2 cups of strong coffee and let cool.
2. In a medium saucepan, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture boils. Boil gently for 1 minute, remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Cover tightly and chill in refrigerator 1 hour. 
3. In the meantime, in a medium bowl beat cream with vanilla and Amaretto (or other liquor) if using until stiff peaks form. (J'ai ajouté 1 t. de sucre de canne en poudre)
4. Whisk mascarpone into yolk mixture until smooth.
5. Mix with the whipped cream Arrange half of soaked in coffee ladyfingers in bottom of a 7x11 inch dish. Spread some of the cream mixture over the ladyfingers. Repeat the layers but put a thin layer this second time and then spoon the leftover cream and a piping bag and pipe dollops on top. (See video [https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/easy-10-minute-tiramisu/](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/easy-10-minute-tiramisu/) )Sprinkle with cocoa. Cover and refrigerate 4 to 6 hours (or overnight), until set. (Au moins 24 heures)
