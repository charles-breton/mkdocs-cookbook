# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Pour the cool water in a medium size mixing bowl and add the gelatin powder.
2. Stir briskly until mixed. It will start to thicken a lot.
3. Add the ¼ cup of really hot water and stir to mix. It should be thinner now.
4. Pour in the juice and mix well.
5. Place fresh fruit in a layer on the bottom of an 8x8 baking dish if using.
6. Pour the jello mixture over the fruit and stir slightly to make sure it has coated the fruit.
7. Put in the refrigerator, covered, for at least 2-3 hours or overnight.
8. Cut into cubes or scoop out with a melon baller to make cute shapes.
9. Enjoy.

## NOTES

Can double recipe. Also, do not use fresh pineapple juice alone for this recipe. The enzymes in fresh pineapple prevent the gelatin from "gelling"
