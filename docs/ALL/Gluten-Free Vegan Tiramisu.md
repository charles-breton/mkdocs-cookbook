# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 80g rice flour  
- [ ] 50g almond flour  
- [ ] 100 ml [plant milk](http://www.ingeniouscooking.com/tag/plant-milk/)*  
- [ ] 25g coconut oil  
- [ ] pinch of baking soda  
- [ ] couple drops of apple cider vinegar  
- [ ] pinch of stevia powder  
- [ ] 1 teaspoon of [vanilla extract](http://www.ingeniouscooking.com/home-made-vanilla-extract/)

#### _for the vanilla cream:_  
- [ ] 150g coconut oil  
- [ ] 300 ml plant milk*  
- [ ] 200 ml coconut cream  
- [ ] 1/4 teaspoon of stevia powder  
- [ ] beans scraped from one vanilla pod  
- [ ] 2 teaspoons of [vanilla extract](http://www.ingeniouscooking.com/home-made-vanilla-extract/)  
- [ ] 2 tablespoons (20g) of starch**

- [ ] 1 cup of strong coffee (caffeine free, if desired)  
- [ ] cocoa- or carob powder for sprinkling

-I did the carb count at the end of this post based on almond- or soy milk (approx. 2.5g carbs/100 ml). You can use different milks, of course, but the numbers may vary.  
--I used and recommend tapioca starch, but it also might work with oher starches, e.g. corn starch.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. At first prepare the sponge cake bites. Mix plant milk, coconut oil, heat it until lukewarm, then add a few drops of apple cider vinegar: it’s going to get thick.
2. Combine rice flour, almond flour, stevia powder, baking soda and salt in a small mixing bowl.
3. Work milky mixture into the dry ingredients: you should get a thick, pancake-like texture. Line a baking pan with baking sheets and form 8 disk shapes with a spoon. Bake them at 180 C / 360 F for 15 minutes.
4. While the sponge cake bites are in the oven, you can prepare the vanilla cream. Set aside a small portion of the milk, and put the rest of it on the stove with the coconut oil, vanilla beans and vanilla extract. Start heating.
5. Mix tapioca starch and stevia powder with the rest of the milk until smooth, no clots. When the hot milk portion is almost boiling, pour in the starchy mixture and start whisking: mix it until the cream gets thick but do not bring it to a boil. Taste check if it’s sweet enough and set aside to cool.
6. Beat the coconut cream into stiff peaks and when the vanilla cream is only lukewarm, fold coconut whip into vanilla cream.
7. From now on it goes as expected: some vanilla cream at the bottom of the cups, cocoa powder, sponge cake bites generously sprinkled with coffee, and again cream, cocoa powder, and so on. Use coffee generously, as the sponge cake bites will soak it up over time.
8. Set aside the cups in a cool place and leave some time before serving for the tastes to really come together. Enjoy!
