# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Grate the cauliflower pieces in a food processor with the grater attachment in place. You can also use the regular attachment and pulse until the cauliflower is riced.
2. Transfer the riced cauliflower to a large, non-reactive bowl, and add in the kale, sundried tomatoes, parsley, basil, pine nuts, hemp seeds, and pepitas.
3. Make the dressing by adding the lemon juice, tahini, garlic, water, sea salt, and black pepper to a blender. Blend on high for 1-2 minutes or until smooth and creamy. If desired, add in ½-1 teaspoon agave nectar to balance the acidity of the dressing.
4. Pour the dressing over the cauliflower mixture and toss to coat.

  

Serve and refrigerate leftovers.
