# INSTRUCTIONS

#### Important:

1. If you have't read the post, go back and read it. I include some important tips on how to make the bread as well as a caution. **Use a digital kitchen scale to measure the ingredients by WEIGHT, not volume.**
    
#### Preparation:

1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a **8×4 inch metal loaf pan** with baking spray. Heat a kettle of water to a boil. Grind the golden flax meal in a coffee grinder to make sure it is very fine.
    
2. Place a large bowl on a **digital kitchen scale**, turn it on, zero it out, and measure 10 ounces of almond flour into the bowl. Zero the scale and measure 3 ounces of golden flax meal into the bowl. Zero the scale and change it to grams. Measure 100 grams of psyllium powder into the bowl, then add the salt and baking powder. Remove the bowl from the scale and mix the ingredients with a hand mixer to ensure that they are evenly distributed.
    
3. Put a smaller bowl in the scale, turn it on, zero it out and measure 8 ounces of egg whites into the bowl. Zero out the scale and add 3 ounces of vinegar.
    
4.  Pour the egg white mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and mix at a high speed until just combined. (The mixture will begin to expand a bit.) It should only take 10 seconds. DO NOT OVER MIX.
    
5. Quickly rinse out the small bowl and return it to the scale. Zero the scale and add the 14 ounces of hot water. Pour the hot water onto the ingredients previously mixed with the egg whites (don’t just dump it into the middle) and again, mix quickly at high speed, just until incorporated 10-15 seconds. If there is a little dry bread mix in the bottom of the bowl, it’s okay.
    
#### Method: (Get ready. It’s time to pay attention)

 1. Gently remove the dough with your hands, (it will be cool) and ever-so-slightly and gently, shape it into a loaf shape while bringing it to the bread pan. Put the Psyllium-flax bread dough into the pan – it will not be perfect and there may be gaps in the corners or one side may be a little higher than the other – it’s okay, put it into the oven.
    
2. Bake for 80-90 minutes, depending on your oven. Depending on your oven, it may need a little more time. It is done when the internal temperature is 205-210 degrees F.
    
3. Let the loaf cool in the pan for only 5 minutes and then remove and place on a cooling rack to cool completely. If left in the pan to cool, the steam from the bread may make the loaf soggy. I place it on its side for 5 minutes, then set it right side up to finish cooling. Don’t cut the bread until it is almost completely cool.
    
4. Makes 20 slices with 3 net carbs per slice.

## NOTES

#### Storing:

- Store in an airtight bag in the refrigerator for about 10-12 days. The bread freezes beautifully. Thaw in the fridge. It’s best to pan fry/toast the bread instead of using a toaster.

## TIPS

People at high altitudes have had success cooking this bread in a toaster oven.

One commenter mentioned that removing the bread from the pan after cooking and putting it back in the oven for about 10 minutes helps dry out the bottom which has the tendency to compact a little and sometimes be more dense.
