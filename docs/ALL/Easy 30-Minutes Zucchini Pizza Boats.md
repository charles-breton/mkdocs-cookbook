I love these zucchini pizza boats because you can make the toppings very similar to how you would your fave pizza! I opted for a “Deluxe” style pizza with sausage, mushrooms, green pepper and red onions, but the flavour combos are limitless with this recipe! Here are some more delicious ideas:

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat olive oil in a large skillet over med-high heat. Add turkey and seasonings, crushing up with a crushing spoon and mixing well. Cook for 5-6 minutes until turkey is browned and fully cooked. Remove from heat and set aside.  
2. Preheat oven to 400 F. Cut zucchini in half lengthwise and scoop out flesh. On a baking sheet or in a 9x13 casserole dish, spread each zucchini boat with pizza sauce, then top with sausage, mushrooms, red onion, green pepper and cheese.  
3. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until cheese is melted. Remove from oven and sprinkle with fresh basil and chili flakes. Serve and enjoy!

## NOTES

Use store-bought turkey sausage if you’re in a pinch.

Switch up the ingredients to include your favourite pizza toppings.

If you want your zucchini boats to be softer, cook them for 10-15 minutes before adding on the toppings.

Store any leftovers in the fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in the oven at 425° F or in the microwave.
