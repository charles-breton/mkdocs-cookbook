# INSTRUCTIONS

1. **Prepare the cabbage, Daikon root, carrots and place in a big bowl. Sprinkle the salt and the bacterial culture if using.**
2. **Place onion, ginger, turmeric, garlic, & red chili flakes in food processor and blend until smooth.**
3. **Pour mixture onto cabbage and mix together.**
4. **Taste it to see if it is salty enough. Add more salt if needed.**
5. **Pack down into jars, put a leaf of cabbage on top of the vegetables and add filtered water to make sure your veggies are below the brine.**
6. **Put the lids on but not too tightly closed to allow air to come out and let it sit in a cupboard or on the counter* out of direct sunlight for 2-4 weeks depending on how sour you like it. (It takes more like 1 week with the bacterial culture). Compact the content of the jars frequently to allow air to be expelled and come to the surface.**
7. *** I put my jars in a closed cooler at room temperature just so that the temperature is more stable and if liquid comes out it is not messy.**
