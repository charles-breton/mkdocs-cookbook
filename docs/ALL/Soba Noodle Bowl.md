# INSTRUCTIONS

#### **Noodles:** 
1. Cook soba noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse the soba noodles under cool running water (this helps them to not turn mushy!). (Note: _If using 100% soba noodles, careful to watch the water after 2 minutes or so, it will start to become foamy and bubble over – turn the heat to medium and back up again as needed to keep the water at a boil but not boiling over.)_

#### **Miso Sauce:** 
1. In a small bowl, whisk together the miso sauce ingredients together, set aside.

#### **Assemble:** 
1. Serve noodles in individual bowls with 1/3 cup each sugar snap peas, shredded carrots, cucumber, and red cabbage. Top with radishes, sliced scallions, sesame seeds, cilantro and lime wedges to squeeze over top. Drizzle dressing overtop and enjoy!

#### **Store:** 
1. Leftovers can be kept in the refrigerator for up to 4 days in a covered container.
