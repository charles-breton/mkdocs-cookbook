# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In a large bowl, whisk all ingredients together until smooth. Let the batter sit for a minute or two to account for the natural thickening caused by coconut flour. The batter should be very runny right before cooking - it should pour easily (add more almond milk and eggs in *equal* proportions if needed to achieve this).
    
2. Heat a small skillet (about 8" diameter) over medium to medium-high heat and grease lightly (use oil of choice or an oil mister). Pour 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet and immediately tilt in different directions to evenly distribute. You can fill in the sides with a little more batter if needed. Cook, covered with a lid, until the edges are golden and you see bubbles forming in the middle. The edges will curl inward when you lift the lid (about 1-2 minutes). Flip over, cover again, and cook until browned on the other side (1-2 more minutes). Repeat until the batter is used up.

## NOTES

****Serving size:** 1 8-inch tortilla

- Nutrition info does not include optional ingredients, and assumes coconut milk beverage for the milk of choice, but almond milk is very similar. Dairy milk will make carb count higher.
- Exact amounts of eggs and milk needed can vary slightly based on your brand of coconut flour, how tightly it sits in the measuring cup, etc. The post above explains how to get the right consistency, and how to thin out the batter if it’s too thick.
- **For the best coconut flour tortillas, please see additional preparation and troubleshooting tips in the post above!**
- A variation with optional gelatin is an option for more pliable, sturdy tortillas. This requires an extra 1/4 cup almond milk.
