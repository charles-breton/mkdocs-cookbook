This homemade paleo and keto nutella hazelnut spread is **truly unbelievable**! Ultra rich and chocolatey, **its taste is so spot** on that you’ll never miss the store-bought version again (for real!).

Oh, and if baking with cups rather than grams is your thing, just click on US Cups for an instant conversion.

# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 400 g [hazelnuts](https://amzn.to/2PWLtIh)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon [avocado oil](https://amzn.to/2JjzdMt)

- [ ] 2-6 tablespoons [powdered xylitol](https://amzn.to/2J0ED01) erythritol, or allulose*

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat ovento 300°F/150°C. Place the hazelnuts in a rimmed baking tray and toast them until lightly golden and fragrant (10-14 minutes). While still warm, wrap them in a kitchen towel and rub vigorously to remove the skins (some bits will remain, worry not!).
2. Transfer hazelnuts to a food processor and process until it begins to form into a paste, add avocado oil and continue until smooth (about 10-14 minutes). How smooth you get the hazelnut butter will depend on how powerful your blender/processor is (and how sharp the blades still are!). Add cocoa, powdered sweetener and salt to taste.
3. Pour homemade nutella onto a mason jar (or airtight container) and refrigerate until set (will keep well for roughly a month!).

## NOTES

*Make sure you **use a powdered sweetener** (I simply run it in my bullet/blender until powdered!). 

**Top tip:** feel free to use **a store-bought hazelnut butter** ([Biona’s is really good](https://amzn.to/2UujzAM) to speed up the process (or if you don't have a powerful food processor/blender).
