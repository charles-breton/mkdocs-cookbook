# INSTRUCTIONS

1. [Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (176 degrees C) and line an 8"x8" pan with parchment paper or spray with baking spray.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
2. [In a large bowl, mix together the eggs, vanilla, coconut sugar, and apple sauce and let this sit for 5 minutes to let the coconut sugar dissolve.](http://www.mediavine.com/)

3. [In a separate medium bowl, mix together the flour, cocoa powder (sifted if lumpy!), baking soda and salt. Make sure there are no clumps before going on to the next step.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
4. [Add the dry mix to the wet, gently stir until combined. Be sure not to over mix!](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
5. [Then fold in the zucchini and 1 cup chocolate chips.](http://www.mediavine.com/) 
    
6. [Pour the batter into the pan and even the surface with a spatula.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
7. [Sprinkle 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips on top.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
8. [Bake for 30 - 35 minutes (14 minutes for the half batch) or until a toothpick inserted in the middle doesn't come out gooey. It might still be sticky - just not have raw batter on it.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
    
9. [Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days at room temperature or up to one week in the refrigerator. I recommend storing them in the refrigerator right from the beginning due to their high moisture content.](http://www.mediavine.com/)
