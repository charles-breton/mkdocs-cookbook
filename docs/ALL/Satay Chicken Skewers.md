# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Combine the lime zest and juice, coconut oil, tamari, fish sauce, garlic, ginger, and ground spices in a large bowl and mix well. Add the chicken and toss until thoroughly coated in the marinade.
    
2. Transfer the chicken and marinade to a large, sealable plastic bag and marinate for at least 2 hours. 
    
3. Soak 8 bamboo skewers in a shallow dish of cold water for at least 30 minutes, then drain.
    
4. **To make the cashew satay sauce:** combine the cashews and almond butter in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until the nuts are well-ground.
    
    Add the ginger and chili and process until well-blended. Add the tamari, sesame oil and maple syrup, and blend well. 
    
    Gradually pour in 4 tablespoons of water and pulse until the sauce becomes smooth. If the sauce is a little too thick, simply add more water. Set aside. Season with a little salt if desired. 
    
5. Preheat a barbecue or grill plate to medium-high. 
    
6. Thread the marinated chicken cubes onto the prepared skewers and season with salt and pepper.
    
7. Grill the skewers, basting with the marinade, for 3 minutes on each side until browned and cooked through. Season with salt and pepper if needed. 
    
8. To serve, warm the satay dipping sauce if desired. Scatter the coriander leaves over the skewers and serve with the lime halves and the satay sauce on the side.
