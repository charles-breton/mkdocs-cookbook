# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 9 inch pie plate with gluten-free, non-stick cooking spray.
2. Prepare the crust by combining the almond flour, dates and salt in a food processor. Pulse until the dates and almond flour are well combined. Add the oil and process until the mixture starts to come together like a dough. If the mixture is too dry add some more oil, a few drops at a time. Bake for 12 – 15 minutes or until the crust has browned, it may seem soft but it will harden up as it cools. Let cool completely.
3. Prepare the filling by combining the bananas, dates, coconut milk, cocoa powder and vanilla in a food processor. Process until smooth. Pour the mixture into the cooled pie crust, top with the sliced almonds and chopped or shaved chocolate, cover with plastic wrap and freeze for at least 4 hours. Can be made 1 – 2 days ahead.
4. About ½ hour before serving, take the pie from the freezer, remove the plastic wrap and let set at room temperature until it is soft enough to cut. Slice and serve immediately.
