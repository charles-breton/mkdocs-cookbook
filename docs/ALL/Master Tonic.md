## NOTES

Your master tonic is ready for use. You do not need to keep the tonic in your fridge. It will last for long.

## TIPS

Extra Tip: You can also use it in the kitchen – mix it with some olive oil and use it as a salad dressing or in your stews.

**Caution**: The flavor is very strong and hot!

  

2 Extra Tip: Eat a slice of orange, lemon or lime after you take the tonic to ease the burning sensation and heat.

  

3 Gargle and swallow.

  

4 Do not dilute it in water as it will reduce the effect.

  

5 Take 1 tablespoon every day to strengthen the immune system and fight cold.

  

6 Increase the amount every day until you reach a dose of 1 small glass per day (the size of a liquor glass).

  

7 If you struggle against more serious disease or infection, take 1 tablespoon of the tonic 5-6 times a day.

  

8 It is safe for pregnant women and children (use small doses!) because the ingredients are all-natural and contain no toxins.

  

Warning: Do not use on an empty stomach, and start with a teaspoon for the first few times. It is POTENT and can cause nausea or vomiting if you are not used to it.

### *EXTRA* :



## **Health benefits**
  
Garlic is a strong antibiotic with a wide range of health benefits. Unlike chemical antibiotics that kill millions of friendly bacteria your body needs, its only goal is bacteria and microorganisms. Garlic also encourages and increases the level of healthy bacteria. It is a powerful antifungal agent and destroys any antigen, pathogen, and harmful disease-causing microorganisms.

  

Onion is garlic’s closest relative and it has a similar but milder action. Together they create a strong fighting duo.

  

Horseradish is a powerful herb, efficient for sinuses and lungs. It opens sinus channels and increases circulation, where common colds and flu usually begin, as most doctors would agree.

  

Ginger has powerful anti-inflammatory properties and it is a strong circulation stimulant.

  

Chili peppers are the most powerful circulation stimulators. They just send their antibiotic properties to fight the disease where it is mostly needed.

  

Turmeric is the most perfect spice, cleanses infections and reduces inflammation. Blocks the development of cancer, and prevents dementia. It is especially useful for those who struggle with joint pain.

  

Apple cider vinegar – there must be something very healthy in the use of apple cider vinegar as the father of medicine, Hippocrates, used vinegar around 400 BC because of its healthy properties. It is said that he used only two remedies: honey and apple cider vinegar.

  

Apple cider vinegar is made from fresh and ripe apples which are later fermented and go through rigorous process to give the final product. Apple cider vinegar contains pectin, a fiber that reduces bad cholesterol and regulates blood pressure.

  

Health experts agree that people need more calcium as they get old. Vinegar helps the extraction of calcium from foods it is mixed with, which helps in the process of maintaining bone strength. Potassium deficiency causes a variety of problems including hair loss, brittle nails and teeth, sinusitis, and runny nose.

  

Apple cider vinegar is rich in potassium. Studies have shown that potassium deficiency results in slow growth. All of these problems can be avoided if you use apple cider vinegar regularly. Potassium also removes toxic wastes from the body.

  

Beta-carotene prevents damage caused by free radicals, maintains skin firm and young. Apple cider vinegar is good for those who want to lose weight.

  

It breaks up fat which supports a natural weight loss process. Apple cider vinegar contains malic acid, efficient in the fight against fungal and bacterial infections. This acid dissolves uric acid deposits that form around the joints, and thus alleviates joint pain. Dissolved uric acid is later eliminated from the body.

  

It is believed that apple cider vinegar is useful in treating conditions like constipation, headaches, arthritis, weak bones, indigestion, high cholesterol, diarrhea, eczema, sore eyes, chronic fatigue, mild food poisoning, hair loss, high blood pressure, obesity, and many other health problems.

  

The master tonic is the best combination to fight each of these conditions. Protect your health using natural antibiotics!
