# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (or Tamari if gluten free)
- [ ] 1/2 cup chicken stock (or vegetable broth if vegan)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon corn starch (or arrow root)
- [ ] 1 tablespoon honey (or agave nectar if vegan)
- [ ] 1 teaspoon sesame seed oil
- [ ] 1 teaspoon rice vinegar
- [ ] 2 inch piece of ginger, peeled and grated or finely minced (or 1 tablespoon ginger paste in a squeeze tube, and other readers have had success with 1 tablespoon ground powdered ginger)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Whisk all ingredients together. Adjust the amount of sauce you add according to how much stir fry you’re making. When adding to your stir fry, allow to cook for 3 full minutes to allow the corn starch to thicken the sauce.
    
2. Makes 1-1/4 cups. Will keep refrigerated in an airtight container for 1 week.

## NOTES

#### Ingredient Notes

- **Soy Sauce:** I like to use **low-sodium soy sauce** to make this recipe healthier. If you’re looking for a gluten-free soy sauce alternative, try Tamari (you seriously can’t tell the difference!). If you’re soy-free, use [coconut aminos](https://rstyle.me/n/deujxmci6ux).
- **Chicken Stock (or [Chicken Broth](https://www.tasteslovely.com/instant-pot-chicken-stock-bone-broth-paleo-whole30-keto/)):** I use [Kettle + Fire organic chicken bone broth](https://www.kf91trk.com/S6K6H8/9B9DM/) (my favorite! Use code TASTESLOVELY for 20% off!) for this recipe, but if you’re vegan, use vegetable broth. It’s a totally easy substitution that still tastes just as good!
- **Thickener:** You can use corn starch, but [Tapioca Flour](https://rstyle.me/n/derdccci6ux) or [Arrowroot powder](https://rstyle.me/n/derddeci6ux) is a healthier swap. These have fewer carbs and are excellent thickeners!
- **Honey:** Instead of brown sugar, I use honey. You can also use [maple syrup](https://rstyle.me/n/deixavci6ux) or agave nectar if you want a vegan alternative. You can also use brown sugar if you prefer, but I like using natural sweeteners. It’s really up to you!
- **Sesame Oil**: This adds richness and depth that is so delicious.
- **Rice Vinegar:** This is where the sweet, tangy flavor comes from, and I personally love it. It’s a very mild vinegar, so it won’t overwhelm the sauce.
- **Fresh** **Ginger & Garlic:** I like to use fresh ginger and mince fresh garlic cloves for this recipe. It adds such a strong, delicious flavor. In a pinch, you can also use powdered ginger and [garlic powder](https://rstyle.me/+wh_4hEixRh2r15xcLKzb1A) or a jar of minced garlic.

#### Substitutions

- **Soy Sauce:** If you are soy-free, you can substitute liquid aminos or [coconut aminos](https://rstyle.me/n/deujxmci6ux) in the same quantities. If you are looking for a gluten-free option, try Tamari.
- **[Chicken Stock](https://www.tasteslovely.com/instant-pot-chicken-stock-bone-broth-paleo-whole30-keto/):** You can use chicken, beef, or veggie broth/stock. You can also use water if that’s all you have on hand.
- **Fresh Ginger:** Use 2 teaspoons of powdered ginger instead of fresh ginger. 
- **Cornstarch:** In place of cornstarch, you can use all-purpose flour or [tapioca flour](https://rstyle.me/n/derdccci6ux) (which is gluten-free!). Same quantity for all substitutions.
- **Honey:** In place of honey you can use [maple syrup](https://rstyle.me/n/deixavci6ux), agave nectar, white sugar, brown sugar, or [coconut sugar](https://rstyle.me/n/deuk5uci6ux). Same quantity for all substitutions.
- **Rice Vinegar:** In place of rice vinegar, you can use white vinegar.

## TIPS

- When you add this sauce to your stir-fried veggies and protein, add the sauce last. Cook the sauce for 3 minutes over medium-high heat to allow the thickening agent to thicken.
- If you need a larger yield, click on the printable recipe in the recipe card below and adjust the number of servings. Changing the number of servings will adjust the ingredient amounts.

#### Storage Tips

- **Leftovers:** Store leftovers in an airtight container or mason jar with a lid in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, though you will probably eat them sooner!
- **Freezing:** If you have leftovers, you can freeze them! Freeze in any freezer-safe container for up to 6 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, then reheat it over the stovetop to use for any Asian-inspired recipe.
