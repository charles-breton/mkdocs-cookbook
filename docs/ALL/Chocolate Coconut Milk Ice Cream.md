## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

1 14 oz. can full-fat coconut milk (<– this brand is BPA-free)

1/4 cup honey (or maple syrup, for vegans) (pour 2 recettes 1/2 t. - 2 c. Tab de miel)

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

# INSTRUCTIONS

Combine all of the ingredients in a blender, and blend until smooth and creamy. Put the blender bowl in the freezer and mix every 30 minutes for 3-4 hours

## NOTES

This recipe makes roughly 3 cups of ice cream, so the nutrition information is for a 1/2 cup serving. This is automatically calculated, and is just an estimate, not a guarantee.

**Don't have an ice cream maker?** Simply pour the blended chocolate mixture into an airtight container and freeze overnight. Stir the mixture every hour or two, to help incorporate air into the ice cream, making it more light and fluffy.

 This recipe was originally posted in 2012, and has been updated in August 2021. The original measurements were 1 (13.5 oz.) can coconut milk + 6 tablespoons cacao powder + 1/4 cup honey (or maple syrup) + 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. The updated recipe gives a much better chocolate flavor and a less-icy texture compared to the original, so I hope you’ll enjoy it!
