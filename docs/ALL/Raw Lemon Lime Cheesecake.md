# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Process all base ingredients into a fine sticky crumble in a food processor. Divide between your 2 4" springform pans (or whatever pan you're using -- see notes above), and press down into a flat even crust. Freeze while working on the next step.
    
2. Blend all lemon layer ingredients into a smooth consistency in a power blender. Divide evenly between the two pans and smooth out the tops. Tap the cake pans gently on the counter to flatten the lemon filling. Place in the freezer for 20 mins to firm up.
    
3. Clean out your blender or food processor (I used the food processor for this layer). Blend or process all lime layer ingredients into a smooth consistency. Carefully spoon this mixture over the lemon layers in the two pans little by little (so as not to mix the two layers up), dividing the mixture evenly between the pans. Smooth out the tops carefully with the back of a spoon or a spatula. Decorate with toppings and freeze for 5-6 hours or overnight to set. Enjoy! (Store leftovers in the freezer).

## NOTES

*To pre-soak cashews: place in a glass bowl, cover with water, and leave to soak for 4 hours (or overnight in the fridge). Then strain and discard the water. For a quick pre-soak, cover with boiled water and soak for 15 mins, then strain and discard water. (Note: this technique doesn’t preserve the nutrition of the recipe as well as the traditional soaking technique above). Note: the purpose of soaking the nuts is to re-hydrate them and plump them up for blending into a smooth, cheesecake-like consistency. Proper soaking techniques also maximize nutrition and digestibility. If you’re interested in learning more about nut soaking and other dessert prep tips and tricks, I delve into these subjects in detail in my book _[Unconventional Treats](https://www.unconventionalbaker.com/unconventional-treats-book-videos-options-hp/)_.
