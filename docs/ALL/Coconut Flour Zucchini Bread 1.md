2. Grease a small loaf pan (8"x4" or smaller) with coconut oil or line with parchment paper; set aside.
3. Shred your zucchini finely, and then use a nut milk bag or cheesecloth to thoroughly squeeze all the moisture out of it.
4. Mix the egg, honey or syrup, oil, and banana together in a large bowl.
5. Mix in the dry ingredients and zucchini, then add the apple cider vinegar, and stir until the batter is smooth.
6. Stir in the nuts, if using.
