# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 tablespoon coconut flour

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Mix the coconut flour and baking powder with the
water (or milk) and egg whites. Whisk or blend until all
lumps disappear (| usually mix, then wait a couple of
minutes and mix again).

2. Pour all the batter on a heated pan greased with olive
oil (grease well). Pour batter in center of pan. Tilt the
pan around to spread the batter into a large circle,
almost covering the entire bottom of the pan.

3. Be very careful with this part: wait until the edges are
brown on the side of the tortilla, or carefully circle
spatula around the bottom of tortilla until safe to flip.
Once safe, flip the tortilla and cook for about 30
seconds on the other side.

4. Fill with cream, berries, enchilada filling - anything
you like!

5. These are thin and delicate. Use them for low-carb
enchiladas, sandwich wraps, or anything you can
think of!
