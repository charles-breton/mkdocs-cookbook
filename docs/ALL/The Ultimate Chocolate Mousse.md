A velvety smooth chocolate mousse that’s guilt-free and loaded with superfoods and antioxidants. My purely delicious chocolate mousse is made from ripe avocado that is blended with [Naked Chocolat](https://secure.thehealthychef.com/shop/drinking-chocolate) and scented with pure Madagascan vanilla and a pinch of artisan sea salt. The addition of coconut cream will make the texture light and delicious.

## NOTES

This mousse is delicious on its own or used as a topping for cakes and cupcakes.
  
The addition of cold pressed coconut oil will firm up the mousse.
  
I love to serve this mousse as part of a dessert served with smashed raspberries or spread over a fresh made [chocolate cake](https://www.thehealthychef.com/2013/08/healthy-chocolate-cake/).
