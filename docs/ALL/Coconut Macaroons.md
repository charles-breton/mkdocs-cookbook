These delicious coconut macaroons are the perfect snack to have in your repertoire. Most of us have shredded coconut in our pantries, and eggs in the fridge. And that plus 10 minutes is basically all you need to whip these up. Which means, you can make them on a whim for a healthy sweet tooth fix, snacky kids, or unexpected guests. They also pack well for hikes, road trips, etc.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
  
2. In a large bowl, whisk egg whites with honey and salt until well combined and frothy (approx. 30 seconds).
  
3. Whisk in lemon zest and vanilla, just to combine.
  
4. Add in coconut and stir until it is well coated by the egg white mixture.
  
5. Line baking sheet with parchment paper.
  
6. Drop large tablespoons of the mixture onto the baking sheet and form into mounds (I used a 1.5 tablespoon measuring spoon to get that nice round shape).
  
7. Bake until golden, approx. 15-20 minutes, rotating halfway through.
  
8. Place baking sheet on a rack and allow macaroons to cool.
