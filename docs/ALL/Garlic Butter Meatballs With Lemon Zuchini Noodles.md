# INSTRUCTIONS

**1.** To make this turkey meatballs recipe: In a large [bowl](https://amzn.to/40h9qui), combine ground turkey and ground pork, cheese, grated garlic, Italian seasoning, bouillon cube, red chili pepper flakes, chopped cilantro, and black pepper. Mix well with your hands or fork and form medium turkey meatballs. Arrange the turkey meatballs on a [plate](https://amzn.to/3jqrTUS) and set them aside.

**2.** Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a [large](https://amzn.to/2nOVV4f) [skillet](https://amzn.to/3YlYb2a) over medium-low heat. Cook the **turkey meatballs** for 8 – 10 minutes on all sides, until browned and cooked through. While cooking, baste the turkey meatballs with a mix of butter and juices. Remove to a clean plate and set aside.

**3.** In the same skillet melt the remaining tablespoon of butter; then add lemon juice, hot sauce, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if you want). Add the zucchini noodles and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring regularly, until zucchini noodles are done but still crisp and juices have reduced a bit. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and garnish with more cilantro or parsley if you like.

**4.** Push zucchini noodles on one side of the skillet add the turkey meatballs back to the [pan](https://amzn.to/3wSbxXZ) and reheat for a minute or two. Serve the **garlic butter turkey meatballs with lemon zucchini noodles** immediately with a lemon slice on the side. Enjoy!

## TIPS



- Ground pork in this recipe allows the **turkey meatballs** to be more juicy and tender. If you don’t eat pork, just double the amount of ground turkey, it’s delicious too!
- Zucchini noodles tend to render some water when cooking, so you can sprinkle with salt after spiralizing and allow to sit for a couple of minutes to take off excess water. Rinse well to get rid of salt and drain thoroughly Zucchini noodles in a colander before cooking.
- Make sure to **cook the turkey meatballs** on medium fire to avoid burning them while still raw on the inside.
- This **turkey meatballs recipe** is also perfect for a meal prep lunch on the next day. Check this [meatball meal prep recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/meal-prep-garlic-butter-chicken-meatballs-recipe-zucchini-noodles) for a variant with chicken.

##### HOW TO KEEP THE TURKEY MEATBALLS LEFTOVERS?
