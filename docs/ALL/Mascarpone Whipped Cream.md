# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Chill a large mixing bowl in the fridge (optional, but strongly encouraged).
2. In your chilled bowl using a hand mixer or stand mixer, combine mascarpone cheese and sugar on a high speed until completely combined.
3. 4 ounces mascarpone cheese
4. 1/4 cup granulated sugar
5. Add vanilla and heavy cream, and mix on a low setting until it is mostly combined. Now increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form – it may take a little while, so be patient!
6. 1 cup heavy cream
7. 1/4 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
8. Once your cupcakes, cake or whatever treat you desire to top this with is cooled and ready to go, fit a piping bag with desired tip and go to town with frosting them. Enjoy!

## NOTES

- **You can use either a stand mixer or a hand mixer** for this recipe, but a stand mixer will save your arm from getting sore!
- **Don't over-whip the mixture** because you'll end up with a weird butter! Mix on high speed just until stiff peaks form.
- **Chocolate version:** Want to make it chocolate? Add an extra 1 tablespoon granulated sugar and 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder.
- **Storage:** Store in an airtight container in the fridge for 3-4 days.
- **Freezing:** You _can_ do is prepare individual servings for later by doing the following:
    - Drop piped mounds of this whipped cream onto a parchment-linked baking sheet
    - Carefully cover, and then freeze overnight
    - The next day, you can peel the mounds of whipped cream off the parchment paper and transfer them to a freezer-safe container for storage
    - To add to a mug of your favorite hot chocolate, just grab one and drop it on top!
    - If you plan to use it as garnish on a cake, pie, etc., just let them thaw in the fridge for about 15 minutes before adding them.
