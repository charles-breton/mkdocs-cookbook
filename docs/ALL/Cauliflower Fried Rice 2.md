# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 4 tablespoons butter (divided)
- [ ] 2 medium carrots (peeled and diced)
- [ ] 1 small white or yellow onion (diced)
- [ ] ½ cup frozen peas
- [ ] 3 cloves garlic (minced)
- [ ] 4 cups cauliflower rice  (raw cauliflower diced)

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Using a large saute pan, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium heat. Once hot, add the whisked egg, stirring only occasionally until soft scrambled. Remove from pan and set aside.
2. Melt two additional tablespoons of butter and increase heat to medium-high. Add diced carrots, onion, and peas. Stir to coat in butter and allow to cook until slightly brown, stirring occasionally, about 3-5 minutes. Add garlic and allow to cook for an additional minute.
3. Push the sauteed veggies to the sides of the pan, add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the middle of the pan, and add the cauliflower rice. Give it a quick stir to distribute the melted butter, but allow it to brown slightly by not stirring for a couple of minutes. Once the bottom of the cauliflower starts to brown, stir all the veggies together and allow them to cook for another couple of minutes.
4. Stir in the green onions, soy sauce, sesame oil, sesame seeds, and cooked egg. Remove from heat. Serve with additional sesame seeds, if desired.

## NOTES

Save yourself some time and buy a bag of cauliflower rice from the store instead of chopping it yourself.
