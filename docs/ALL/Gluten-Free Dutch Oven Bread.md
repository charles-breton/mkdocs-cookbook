# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place a Dutch oven with the lid on in the oven and preheat the oven to 450°F. (Keep the pot in the oven while the bread rises.)
    
2. Combine the yeast, sugar, and warm water in a bowl about twice the size of the mixture and whisk to dissolve the sugar. Let sit until it is foamy and doubled in size, 5-6 minutes. In a small bowl, stir the xanthan gum with the olive oil until the xanthan gum is dissolved.
    
3. Combine flour and salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment (or just the regular beaters – do not use a dough hook). Mix to combine. Add the yeast mixture, xanthan gum mixture, eggs, and vinegar and mix on low to combine. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl once. Turn the mixer to high and mix for 3 minutes.
    
4. Place a piece of parchment paper on a flat surface and dust it with flour. Scrape the dough onto the parchment paper. With wet hands, shape into a dome that will fit in the pot. Cover with a bowl and let rise until doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Cut 1-inch deep slits into the top of the dough to allow the steam to escape. Dust the top with a little flour.
    
5. Carefully remove the pot from the oven and remove the lid. Lift the parchment with the dough on it and lower into the pot. Replace the lid and bake for 45 minutes. Remove the lid and allow to bake for another 10-15 minutes or until the bread is nicely browned. Lift out the paper with the bread on it and place on a wire rack to cool.
