Peri Peri sauce (or piri-piri sauce) traces its origins back to Portugal, but this spicy condiment is widely enjoyed throughout countries such as Angola, Namibia, Mozambique and South Africa. Recipes vary from region to region (and family to family), but they all share one factor: lots of heat. Miss South of [North South Foods](http://www.northsouthfood.com/) whipped up this thick and thoroughly addictive Peri Peri Sauce to use as a marinade/rub for [a variation of barbecued beer-can chicken](http://www.northsouthfood.com/michelada-peri-peri-poussin/), although she writes that "it’s pretty hot, and fairly addictive, especially used raw."

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 400 F. Place the chilies on a roasting tray, along with the foil-wrapped garlic cloves. Roast until the chilies are blackened and blistered, about 25 minutes. Wearing gloves, de-stem and finely chop the red chilies once they're cool enough to handle. De-stem both scotch bonnets also, and remove the seeds from one. Unwrap the garlic cloves from their foil and remove any skins. Place the peppers, garlic, paprika, salt and thyme leaves in a food processor or blender and mix until the ingredients form a thick puree. Add the lemon juice and just enough vinegar to the sauce until its consistency resembles a thick ketchup. Pour into a sterilized jar and keep in the fridge.
