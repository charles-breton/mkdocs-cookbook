## PREP | COMMENTS

**Be sure to purchase the raw groats**, not the roasted variety. This is very important, as **roasted buckwheat flour (the kind you can buy in the store) will NOT work in this recipe** as the two behave very differently in baking. Raw buckwheat flour also has a very mild flavor compared to the traditional roasted buckwheat flour you typically find in the store.

It is also important to **purchase buckwheat that is certified gluten-free** as some brands may be contaminated with wheat berries from growing, harvesting, or storage. Bob's Red Mill buckwheat groats are gluten-free and organic. Grind the buckwheat groats in a hand grinder (that has never been used for wheat), a coffee grinder, or a high-powered blender such as a Vitamix (this is what I use). Chia seeds can be ground to a fine meal in either a coffee grinder or high-powered blender as well. Serve rolls with honey and butter (or coconut butter for a dairy-free option). This recipe can also be found on page 120 of my Nourishing Meals cookbook.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the warm water in a bowl or 4-cup liquid glass measure. Add the yeast and the teaspoon of maple syrup or sugar, whisk together. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes to activate the yeast. The mixture should get foamy or bubbly. If not, dump it out and start over.
2. While the yeast is activating, mix together the dry ingredients in a large bowl (start with 3 ½ cups of the buckwheat flour).
3. After the yeast is activated whisk in the olive oil or butter, maple syrup, ground chia seeds, and psyllium husks into the water-yeast mixture. Let stand for no more than a minute or two to let the chia and psyllium release their gelatinous substances. Whisk again. If you let the mixture rest too long, you run the risk of it absorbing too much liquid.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and mix together with a large wooden spoon until thick. Turn dough out onto a floured wooden board. Add more buckwheat flour, a little at a time, until the dough holds together and isn’t too sticky.
5. For a round loaf, form dough into a ball and place onto a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. Score the dough in a cross pattern to help control how the bread expands while baking later. You can also form the dough into a log and place into an oiled 9x5-inch glass bread dish. To make rolls, form dough into twelve equal-sized balls. This is the time to let children each knead and shape their own ball of dough. Place the balls into two oiled 9-inch pie plates. Cover with a damp towel and place into a warm spot to rise. Let dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes. Rising time will depend on the temperature of the environment around the dough.
6. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Bake bread for 55 to 60 minutes. Bake rolls for 25 to 30 minutes. Cool for about 10 minutes and then serve.
