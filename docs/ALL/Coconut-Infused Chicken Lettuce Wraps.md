# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Wash lettuce leaves gently so as not to damage or tear them. Dry carefully with a towel.
2. Heat the coconut oil in a sauté pan over medium heat. Add the chicken and sauté until browned, breaking up chicken while cooking. Add green onions, water chestnuts, tamari, and chicken broth. Simmer for 5 minutes.
3. Mix the arrowroot with water and add to chicken mixture. Cook over medium high heat, until the sauce thickens.
4. Transfer chicken to a serving bowl set on a large platter and sprinkle gomasio on top. Arrange lettuce leaves on platter around the bowl.
5. Each person takes a lettuce leaf and puts a spoonful of the chicken mixture in it like a taco.
