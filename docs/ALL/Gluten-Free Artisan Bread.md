# INSTRUCTIONS

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, add all dry ingredients and whisk using a handheld wire whisk. Combine the honey and olive oil with the water in a liquid measuring cup. With the mixer on low, slowly add the water mixture. When fully incorporated, turn mixer up to medium high and knead for 5 minutes. Remove the dough hook and scrape the dough into a cohesive mass using a plastic dough scraper or a rubber spatula. Cover with plastic wrap and place the bowl in a warm, draft-free area and allow it to rise (proof) for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in volume.
2. Put the dough in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight, but up to 10 days.
3. On baking day, remove the dough from refrigerator and dump out onto well-floured surface. Knead until fairly smooth, adding more flour as necessary.  It's a somewhat sticky dough so keep a small bowl of flour on hand to sprinkle the dough and/or surface with extra flour.
4. To shape into a boule, simply form into a round ball, pulling the dough up and under the ball and pinching on the bottom.  Place on parchment paper.  To shape into a baguette, smooth dough and begin elongating it and tapering it at the ends, adding more flour as necessary. Roll out as thick or thin as you'd like and as long as you're able to fit in your oven (make sure it will fit on your pizza steel or stone). Place it on a sheet of parchment paper.  
5. Place loaf or loaves, covered loosely with plastic wrap, in a warm, draft-free area to rise until visibly larger, but not doubled in size, about 1/2 to 1 hour. Meanwhile, set up your oven for baking. Place baking steel or stone onto middle rack and shallow pan underneath. Preheat oven to 450° F.  
6. When dough has finished rising and is visibly larger, run a serrated knife under hot tap water and cut slits in dough swiftly but uniformly, about ½-¾ inch deep. Fill up a cup measure with really hot tap water and set aside.
7. Using a pizza peel (paddle), slide loaf (or loaves) into oven onto baking steel (or stone), parchment and all. Immediately pour cup of very hot tap water into the shallow pan.  Quickly shut the oven door.
8. Bake for about 30 minutes for baguettes, or about 35-40 minutes for boules, or longer for larger boules (some larger boules can take up to an hour or more).  If the loaves are getting too browned, you can cover them loosely with foil. The loaves will look crusty and done on the outside, but will feel light when picked up.  If they feel heavy, they're not done yet. Allow to bake for another 10 minutes and then check again, picking up the loaf with two gloved hands. If still feeling heavy, allow to bake for another 5 minutes and check again.
9. Remove from the oven and place on cooling rack.  Allow to cool before cutting (or it will be gummy on the inside).

## NOTES

The recipe makes about 2-3 loaves of bread, depending on how large or small you make them.  You don’t have to make them all in one day.  You can leave the rest of the dough in the refrigerator for another day when you want freshly baked bread. 

You can double or even triple the recipe (if you have a mixer big enough to handle the dough).  A double recipe fits well in my 5-quart Kitchenaid artisan mixer. 

Extra dough may also be frozen.  Wrap in plastic wrap and then in foil and place in the freezer for up to 3 months.  Thaw in refrigerator overnight and then use as normal. 

The possibilities are endless with this dough.  It can be made into so many different shapes and sizes of loaves and you can shape it in about five minutes a day.  You can make pizza with half of it, and bread with the other half!  If you only want to make one loaf in a day, only take out the amount of dough you’ll need for that loaf (usually about a softball to grapefruit-sized amount).  Again, it depends on the size and shape of loaf you’re making. 

The dough will last in the refrigerator for about 10 days, fermenting even more (like sourdough) each day.  It actually gets better with age 🙂

FOR HIGH ALTITUDE BAKING:  Per Beth, who lives in Colorado and graciously offered some high altitude baking conversions, “the crust is perfect – crisp without being like a cracker and enjoyable to bite into. The crumb was perfect, and light which is no small feat considering it is gf. I followed Kim’s recipe for the flour blend. I then adjusted the following in the recipe: Yeast: 2.5 tsp + 1/8th tsp (reduced each tsp by 1/8th tsp). Salt: 1.5 tsp (added 1/2 tsp). Water: 1.5 c. + 3 tbsp added 2 tbsp per cup). I followed the rise times and baking directions exactly. I made 2 loaves: one baguette and one boule. I baked them on my baking stone as directions state. My loaves took 2 hours to grow noticeably larger during the rise after being in the refrigerator overnight. I turned the oven on then off, then put the loaves on a wooden cutting board covered with plastic wrap and also a light cloth while rising. I have a family member who has celiacs and I am gluten and dairy intolerant. I used the pea protein, by the way.”

***DISCLAIMER:  The reason I created my own flour blends is because I could not obtain the results I wanted with flour blends that were available in stores, online, or from other gluten free bloggers.  My recipes have been developed to be used with my own bread flour blend that I created after painstakingly testing for, in some cases, YEARS to develop what I believe to be a superior gluten free bread like no other.  If you do not use my gluten free bread flour blend for this recipe, I cannot speak for the results you will obtain.    While store bought blends may give you a satisfactory result, they may NOT give you the results intended in my recipe.
