# INSTRUCTIONS

1.  [Zucchini] tends to render some water when cooking, so you can [sprinkle with salt after spiralizing and allow to sit for a couple of minutes to take off excess water.] Rinse well to get rid of salt and drain thoroughly in a colander before cooking.
2. To make the turkey meatballs: In a large bowl, combine ground turkey and ground pork, cheese, grated garlic, Italian seasoning, bouillon cube, red chili pepper flakes, chopped cilantro and black pepper. Mix well with your hands or fork and form medium balls. Arrange the turkey meatballs on a plate and set aside.
3. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a [large skillet](https://amzn.to/2nOVV4f) over medium-low heat. Cook the **turkey meatballs** for 8 – 10 minutes on all sides, until browned and cooked through.    [Make sure to cook the meatballs on medium fire to avoid burning them while still raw in the inside.] While cooking, baste the meatballs with the mix of butter and juices. Remove to a clean plate and set aside.
4. In the same skillet melt remaining tablespoon butter; then add lemon juice, hot sauce, minced garlic, and red pepper flakes (if you want). Add the zucchini noodles and cook for 3 or 4 minutes, stirring regularly, until zucchini is done but still crisp and juices have reduced a bit. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and garnish with more cilantro or parsley if you like.
5.  Push zucchini on one side of the skillet and add the turkey meatballs back to the pan and reheat for a minute or two. Serve the **garlic butter turkey meatballs with lemon zucchini noodles** immediately with a lemon slice on the side. Enjoy!

## NOTES

Ground pork in this recipe allows the **meatballs** to be more juicy and tender. If you don’t eat pork, just double the amount of ground turkey, it’s delicious too!

This recipe is also perfect for a meal prep lunch on the next day. Check this [meatball meal prep recipe](https://www.eatwell101.com/meal-prep-garlic-butter-chicken-meatballs-recipe-zucchini-noodles) for a variant with chicken.
