# INGREDIENTS

- [ ] 1 cup uncooked quinoa (that you cook and then let cool down)
- [ ] 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
- [ ] 1 pepper, diced
- [ ] 1 green onion, chopped, or 1/4 of a red onion or something I like to do is to use white onion that I marinate in olive oil mixed with a few capers and caper juice for few hours of overnight) 
- [ ] (If you don’t marinate some onions with the capers add a few capers with some juice to the salad)
- [ ] 2 celery sticks
- [ ] 1 cup of finely chopped fresh parsley
- [ ] Fresh coriander to taste (optional)
- [ ] Once the quinoa has cooled down (could be in the fridge from the night before) add all of the other ingredients.

#### Dressing

- [ ] Juice of 1 lemon
- [ ] 1/3 cup of olive oil (what I do is that I put 1/4 cup of olive oil and then add water to have 1/3 cup)
- [ ] 2 tsp of dried basil
- [ ] 1 tsp of dried mint
- [ ] 1 tsp or dried oregano
- [ ] 3/4 tsp of Himalayan salt.
- [ ] Black pepper to taste 
- [ ] Whisk these ingredients together and add to the quinoa and vegetables. Adjust seasoning to taste.]
