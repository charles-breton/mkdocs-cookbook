**These are THE BEST cinnamon rolls! The recipe is from Todd Wilbur's "More Top Secret Recipes." and www.TopSecretRecipes.com. They're oooey, goooey and rich! I put the ingredients in the night before, and then roll out and bake in the morning. I would like to share the following suggestions by reviewers about the filling "leaking out" during baking: 1) add a few tablespoons flour to the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture 2) using a flour "shaker" or sifter, I lightly dust the margarine with flour before sprinkling with the brown sugar/cinnamon mixture, then again on top of the BS/cinnamon mixture, before rolling up the dough.**

2. **Meanwhile mix the flour, the salt and the remaining sugar in a big bowl.**

4. **Knead the dough into a large ball, using your hands dusted lightly with flour.**
5. **Put in a bowl, cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in size.**
6. **Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface, until it is approx 21 inches long by 16 inches wide. (If we double the recipe we must make a bigger rectangle i.e. 42 in x 16 in!)**

11. **Working carefully, from the long edge, roll the dough down to the bottom edge.**
12. **Cut the dough into 1 1/4 inch slices, and place in a lightly greased baking pan. (Essayer le moyen et le petit Pyrex rectangulaire la prochaine fois)**
