- 1/4 cup [raw honey](http://homemademommy.net/raw-honey)
    
- 2 tsp [blackstrap molasses](http://amzn.to/1abUEWF)
    
- 1 tsp [vanilla](http://www.amazon.com/Simply-Organic-Vanilla-Extract-Certified/dp/B001XWRGS8?tag=homema0cblog-20)
    
- 3/4 – 1 cup [coconut flour](http://www.homemademommy.net/coconut-products)
    
- 1/4 cup [arrowroot powder](http://www.homemademommy.net/2013/07/grain-free-graham-crackers.html?tag=homema0cblog-20)
    
- 1 1/2 tsp [aluminum-free baking powder](https://www.amazon.com/Bobs-Red-Mill-Double-Aluminum/dp/B005P0I7T6?tag=homema0cblog-20)

# INSTRUCTIONS

In a bowl, combine the dry ingredients using only 3/4 cup of the coconut flour. In a [food processor](http://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-DLC-10S-Classic-7-Cup-Processor/dp/B00004S9EM?tag=homema0cblog-20), blend together the softened butter, honey, vanilla and molasses. Add the egg and beat until incorporated into a soft batter.

Add in half of the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients. Then slowly add in the other half. If the dough is still wet and batter-like, then add more coconut flour, a tablespoon at a time. The dough should come together into a ball. When it does, you are done and can stop adding coconut flour. I used 3/4 cup and then added 2 more tablespoons.

Remove your ball of dough and cut it in half. Place each on a piece of wax paper (I like these [wax paper sheets](https://www.amazon.com/Dixie-Kabnet-Paper-Inch-Count/dp/B00BQWPWYK?tag=homema0cblog-20)and you will see why in a minute). The dough can now be refrigerated overnight if you plan on making the crackers another time.

When you are ready to use the dough, remove from the fridge and bring to room temperature.

Place a silpat on your counter and place one of the dough discs on top. With the wax paper sheet on top of the ball, roll out with a rolling pin until the dough is 1/4 inch thick. This method will allow you to simply place the [silpat](https://www.amazon.com/Silpat-AE420295-07-Premium-Non-Stick-Silicone/dp/B00008T960?tag=homema0cblog-20) on your baking sheet to bake.
