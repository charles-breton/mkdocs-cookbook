# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Turn the oven on and preheat it to 350 degrees
2. Use a high speed **[blender](http://drjockers.com/what-is-the-best-vegetable-juicer/)** or food processor and place the sesame seeds, herbs and sunflower seeds and blend until the **[flour](http://drjockers.com/10-reasons-to-bake-with-coconut-flour/)** has formed.(Mettre dans un bol avant de mettre l’eau)
3. Add in the water, 2 tbsps at a time (if you make larger batches), until the seeds all clump together in a ball.
4. Take the dough and put it on parchment paper and roll it (put another piece of parchment paper on top to roll it) until it is very thin for crisper crackers. You can go up to 1/4" inch thick if you want sturdier crackers.
5. Put the parchment paper and dough on a cookie sheet and cut into rectangles with a sharp knife or pizza cutter. Don’t separate the dough yet though.
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown (regarder à 12 minutes à Hunterhaven). Take it out of the oven and give it time to cool on the cookie sheet and then break along the severed lines and serve.
7. Enjoy!
