# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F degrees
2. Place the coconut flour, baking powder, psyllium husk powder and salt in a bowl and mix thoroughly.
3. Add the oil and eggs and blend well until the mixture looks like breadcrumbs.
4. Add the apple cider vinegar and mix well.
5. Add the chopped walnuts to the bread and mix.
6. Gently add the water, a bit at time and stir into the mixture (you may not need it all). Let the mixture sit for 10 minutes.
7. Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
8. Using your hands, make a large ball of the dough (I find keeping my hands wet helps with the sticky dough).
9. Place the dough on the parchment paper lined baking tray.
10. Score the top to make a pattern (optional but looks more rustic)
11. Bake for 35 -40 minutes until golden and firm.
12. Slice, eat and enjoy!
