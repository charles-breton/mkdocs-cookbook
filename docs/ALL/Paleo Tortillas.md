These tortillas are really good. I like to make a bunch ahead of time and have them on hand for lunch, between meals, breakfast burritos or for all sorts of dinner uses, like tacos, burritos, wraps, fajitas, enchiladas – or even in place of naan, pitas or bread. Because they are a lot easier to make than bread and store better.

  

Because the dough lacks gluten, and is therefore much more delicate, I have written in very specific instructions on how to roll them out without tearing or breaking.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Place the flour blend, tapioca starch, sea salt, and baking powder in the bowl of a food processor. Process for a few seconds to combine.
2. With the processor running on low, add the butter pieces, one at a time, to the processor until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Slowly pour in the water, processing just until a thick dough comes together. Let the dough sit in the processor for 5 minutes to allow the coconut flour time to soak up excess moisture
3. Shape the dough into a flat disc, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for one hour.
4. Divide the cold dough into 8 equal balls.
5. Dust a piece of parchment paper with tapioca starch. Place a dough ball on the parchment, flatten slightly with your hand, and sprinkle the top with more tapioca starch.
6. Place another piece of parchment paper on top of the dough and roll twice.?(Peel the paper off of the dough)?, set it down again, and flip the dough over(should still be sandwiched in between parchment paper). Peel the parchment carefully off of the dough and set back down again. Roll twice in the opposite direction you rolled last time. Peel the parchment carefully off of the dough, set back down, flip, peel the parchment off of that side, set back down, and continue to repeat the process until you have a tortilla that is 6-7 inches in diameter. Once the tortilla has been rolled out, keep it on the parchment paper as this will help you flip it onto the pan to cook.
7. Rolling the dough out with this method will help your tortilla not to stick to the parchment or tear as easily since paleo dough is very delicate and difficult to work with without the help of gluten to hold it together.
8. Repeat this process with each dough ball until you have 8 dough discs that are ready to cook.
9. ​Hea​t a skillet or frying pan to medium/high. When the pan is hot, place a tortilla in your palm with the parchment in between your hand and tortilla. Flip the tortilla onto the hot pan so that the parchment paper is on top. Carefully peel off the parchment and discard.
10. Cook the tortilla for about 30 seconds on each side, or until each side has developed golden brown bubbles over the surface. Repeat with the remaining tortillas.
11. Store the tortillas in an airtight container or ziplock bag.

## NOTES

I used a store-bought paleo flour blend for these tortillas that included almond flour, tapioca starch, coconut flour, and arrowroot powder. Bob’s Red Mill makes a paleo flour blend that would work, as well.
