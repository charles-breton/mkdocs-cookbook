## PREP


# INGREDIENTS

- 1 13.5-ounce can [full fat coconut milk](https://amzn.to/2IG1URJ) *
- 135-150 g [xylitol](https://amzn.to/2OvrMTy) or allulose, to taste (see notes for deets!)
- 50-75 g [cocoa powder](http://amzn.to/2xydo3V) use the smaller amount for milk chocolate and the larger for dark
- 1/4 teaspoon [kosher salt](https://amzn.to/2uM2LxM)
- 1/4 teaspoon [xanthan gum](https://amzn.to/2uKe4GF) or 3/4 teaspoon arrowroot flour if paleo**
- 480 g heavy whipping cream or coconut cream
- 1 teaspoon [vanilla extract](http://amzn.to/2gVTsV4)
- 2 tablespoons vodka or booze of choice *** optional



# INSTRUCTIONS

- See recipe video for tips and tricks! 
    
- Add coconut milk, sweetener, cocoa and salt to a saucepan over medium heat. Mix using an immersion blender or whisk until all the solids from the coconut milk have the dissolved and the mixture is fully blended. 
    
- Sprinkle xanthan gum little by little and blend until fully combined. You will likely have some air bubbles, but be sure to check there are no lumps. Any lumps will be resolved by mixing with an immersion blender (or in an actual blender). Remove from heat and allow the mixture to cool completely. 
    
- Add heavy whipping cream to a large chilled bowl and whip until soft peaks form. Blend in vanilla extract and the cooled chocolate mixture. (Optional): add in more cocoa, to taste, for a dark chocolate version. 
    
- (Optional): add in your booze of choice. The mixture should be thick but still pourable. And, if for any reason your mixture is too thick (whipped cream too much, used a lot of cocoa...): thin it out little by little with more coconut milk. See recipe video for texture reference.  
    
- Transfer ice cream to a sealable container and place in the freezer until frozen (4-6 hours to overnight). 
    
- If freezing overnight: take out your ice cream 10-20 minutes prior to serving (depending on your room temp!) and scoop away.

## NOTES

### The Sweetener

**[Xylitol](http://amzn.to/2zdQSBb)** and [allulose](https://amzn.to/2TgGQtC) are, without a doubt, **the best** sweeteners for keto ice cream. They help to retain the creamy texture (they work pretty much like inverted sugars!), and allows you to skip the churning if need be in many recipes.

And if using [allulose](https://amzn.to/2KaXZvO), just keep in mind that it’s about 70% the sweetness of sugar and xylitol (i.e. you’ll have to add 30% more).

Having said that, this no-churn vanilla ice cream is _sooo_ luscious, that you can get away with using [erythritol](https://amzn.to/2K5TjZJ) with relatively good results too. Though it most likely will freeze rock-solid, and you’ll have to let it hang out for about 30 minutes to scoop it out.

And if using xylitol, make sure to **be careful if you have a pup** around the house, as it’s highly toxic to the little guys! 🐕 

*You absolutely NEED to use [full fat coconut milk](http://amzn.to/2x9N7Lq) here! As lighter versions are simply diluted in water, and they'll make your ice cream more icy.

**Be sure to measure a **_very_ lightly packed** 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum, as it's an ingredient that's easy to overpack. And if you overdo it, you'll get gummy ice cream. 

*****Booze is totally optional**, it just keeps your ice cream from freezing rock solid. This ice cream is super creamy though, so 10-15 minutes at room temp make it ultra scoopable once again. 

Please note that nutrition facts were estimated per 1/2 cup serving. This recipe yields approximately 5 cups.
