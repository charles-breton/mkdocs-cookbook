You want to avoid typical mayo that uses refined vegetable oils such as canola, soy and corn oil.  Best to opt for the avocado oil mayo that you can **[order here](https://amzn.to/2XPSa2L)** or find at your health food store. You can also leave out the bacon if you don’t want that in it.  I don’t advocate eating pig meat as you can **[read about here](https://drjockers.com/dont-eat-pig-meat/)** but you can find a good quality grass-fed beef bacon or turkey bacon.

_I had this delightful salad in a restaurant in Hania (Chania), Crete. It is a lovely combo on a hot day, easy to prepare, and not only delicious but loaded with heart and brain-healthy nutrients. Recipe adapted with permission from the Taman Restaurant in Hania, Crete._

## NOTES

Nicole and I had a fantastic time sailing west along the north coast of Crete. The coastline was lovely, the towns had amazing architecture, the food was the best we had in Greece, and the people were friendly. Of course, we were some of the very first tourists that Greece had seen since the Covid-19 lockdown began. As a tourist destination, I highly recommend it, especially Hania, of course, once travel is possible again.

Crete is reported to not having any cases of Covid-19 so far—making it a fantastic and safe vacation destination if you can get there. (Greece has been one of the most successful countries in the world at controlling the virus.) Yet, in Crete, their employees still wear masks in restaurants and public buildings, and everyone wears one in museums and any time you venture inside a building. (You are not allowed to enter a public building or store without a mask and use of hand sanitizer.) I appreciate that they are being cautious and hoping to stay COVID-free. I think they got it right—they practice social distancing and use masks to prevent COVID infections—they are not waiting to have rampant levels of new cases every day that need to be controlled.

Many of the Greek islands import their food from the mainland, limiting the quality of the food that they can create. Crete is an exception as they are large enough to produce their own food, and export food for other parts of the country. They have a tradition of excellent food ingredients, making eating and shopping there a total pleasure.  Enjoy the recipe below!
