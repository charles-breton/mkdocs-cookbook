This bread is gluten-free - dairy free - egg free + sugar-free. Perfect for anyone with a food allergy or intolerance. Technically quinoa is not a grain but a seed and is also a complete protein, which means it contains all the 9 essential amino acids that the body needs for repair. Quinoa is also a good source of lysine, an amino acid important for tissue growth and repair and the formation of collagen which is important for healthy skin.

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Soak quinoa in plenty of cold water overnight in the fridge.
    
2. Soak chia seed in ½  cup water until gel like - this can be done overnight as well, but just give it a few stirs at the beginning.
    
3. Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F - fan forced oven.
    
4. Drain the quinoa and rinse really well through a sieve. Make sure the water is fully drained from your sieve.
    
5. Place the quinoa into a food processor.
    
6. Add chia gel, ½  cup of water, olive oil, baking soda, sea salt and lemon juice.
    
7. Mix in a food processor for 3 minutes. The bread mix should resemble a batter consistency with some whole quinoa still left in the mix.
    
8. Spoon into a loaf tin lined with baking paper on all sides and the base.
    
9. Bake for 1 ½ hours until firm to touch and bounces back when pressed with your fingers. Mine took 1 ½ hours (oven temperatures can vary slightly) but the bread needs the time to cook and for the quinoa to become tender.
    
10. Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes in the tin... then remove from the  tin and cool completely on a rack. The bread should be slightly moist in the middle and crisp on the outside. Cool completely before eating.
    
11. Serve delicate slices only when cold with a serrated knife. Delicious lightly toasted on a pan.

## NOTES

Store wrapped in the fridge for up to 1 week  (Can be frozen for up to 3 months)

What I love about the raw batter before I cook it is that it also lends itself to a variety of dishes. You can bake it as a thin flat bread and use it for a pizza base and top it with sun-dried tomato, roasted pumpkin chunks and ricotta or  you can cook spoonfuls in your cast iron pan just like pancakes or crumpets and drizzle with pure maple syrup and sliced banana.

Serve topped with macadamia nut butter.

Pump up the protein and add 2 tablespoons of Organic Pea protein.  

Sprinkle with sunflower seeds before baking.

The whole seed must be used - please don't use rolled quinoa or the flour.  

Hulled millet can be used in place of quinoa in this recipe.
